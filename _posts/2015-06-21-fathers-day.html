<p>It's here.</p>
<p>FATHER'S DAY.</p>
<p>The day my children are reminded <em>ALL DAY LONG</em> that their daddy is not with them.</p>
<p>This past week has been a very difficult week. We've had meltdowns, angry outbursts, crying for daddy in the middle of the night, and lots of sadness. I did NOT want today to be a continuation of this emotional week. <strong>Jayson was an AMAZING daddy</strong>. His girls adored him with every ounce of their being. He was silly. He loved to pick at them. There has always been way more laughter in our home than there has been tears. I wanted to honor that, not sit around and mope.</p>
<p>So, I made plans. The girls and I were going to spend the day at a water park with family. But, that fell through, so I woke up this morning trying to decide what to do. It didn't have to be something grand, but it had to be fun. I decided to call my mom and take the girls to the new American Girl Store. It was the one place I knew we wouldn't run into lots of daddy's on Father's Day. We skipped church (<em>because, let's face it, making a craft for your father when he's in Heaven is not really all that awesome)</em> and headed off. I made a big deal about getting to look at everything in the store and eating cupcakes with our dolls, Kit and Wild Style (<em>Can you guess who owns Wild Style?).</em> I even told Leah they might be able to get the twin dolls, but we'd have to see.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? You can't get a reservation at a Bistro on the same day. Even if it is Father's Day. I guess other single mom's had the same idea.</p>
<p>I was bummed, but, we were gonna make the best of it. So, we had a lunch of pizza and Japanese in the food court <em>(2 of J's favorites</em>) then started our adventure into American Girl with two 3 year olds, a 7 and 13 year old and 3 adults.</p>
<p>Having never stepped foot in that place, I was in awe! So girlie and fun! They had everything! I'm so glad I had other's with me to help keep an eye on my kids because I was enjoying looking at the dolls and their accessories. I really wanted to get the Girl of the Year, Grace, (<em>for the girl's, of course</em>) but can't just buy one doll for 2 girls.... sadness. Anyway, LuLu tried on dresses in the "Princess Dressing Room" and had to touch everything she saw. Leah wanted it all too and kept trying to talk me into carry bags for her doll and puppies because they need pets! I spent almost as much as I spend on myself for Kit and Wild Style at the Spa. Wild Style really needed it though, her hair was horrific! Kit was pretty with her new braid that Leah meticulously chose. LuLu squealed with excitement as the stylest finished tying ribbons in Wild Style's hair.</p>

<p>We hung around the store for what seemed like hours before Leah reminded me I said we could look at the twin dolls. I called Lauren over and they each got to pick their own. Those dolls, although still not cheap, are half the price of the others so I was reasoning with myself in my head that it was ok. I'm pretty frugal. The dolls my girl's have were bought by other people. But, I figured it was ok because this was a special day of sorts.</p>
<p>While reasoning it out in my head and trying to convince myself it was ok, I did something I rarely do in public. I told the sales lady helping us that today was our first Father's Day without daddy, that we lost him in September and that I was just trying to make it a good day for my babies. I don't tell people about my life in random, everyday conversations. I don't want people to feel sorry for us. But, for some reason, I told this random woman at the American Girl store while my girls were picking out their new dolls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Well, the most extraordinary thing happened</strong></em>.</p>
<p>She went to the back as we anxiously awaited our newest babies and came back with not only the babies, but reservations for the Bistro as well! She said that my story touched her so much that she wanted to do something for us, so they arranged for my family to have desserts on <em>THEM</em>! How amazing is that?!? I totally hugged her. I had woken up with the idea of cupcakes with their dolls on Father's Day and this kind lady made it happen!</p>
<p>LuLu was so overjoyed about her pink cupcake and sprinkles that she shared them with her new baby "Pi" (<em>I'm calling her Penelope</em>). Lulu and Pi were both <em>COVERED</em> in pink icing by the time she was through. Wild Style enjoyed some vanilla ice cream. Both dolls were lucky enough to have LuLu lick their faces of the sugary treats while Leah carefully decorated both her cupcakes with perfection before she ate them.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful day. I'm so thankful for the kindness that was shown to my family today from everyone we encountered. It was a day filled with laughter, excitement and lots of pink cupcakes. If Jayson can't be here to celebrate with us, I think our adventure today was a great plan B. Father's Day without Daddy wasn't near as sad as I thought it would be. Maybe pink cupcakes at the American Girl Bistro will be our new tradition.</p>

<p><em>Happy Father's Day to all you Dad's out there and also to all you Momma's who are pulling double duty. Try to keep it fun!</em></p>

She was trying to hold a menu in front of her face!</p>

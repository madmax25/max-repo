<p>This is Moriah Peters.</p>
<p>She is probably,  without a doubt,  my daughters favorite singer.  Last night,  she FINALLY got to meet her. We've attempted to talk to her the last 3 times we were in the same building and it's for more than just a photo op.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So,  in the summer of 2014 I called into a radio show,  gave the phone to LK, and she won a contest.  Her prize?  Moriah Peters' CD, <em>Brave</em>. That summer,  we listened to the title track on repeat.  Over and over and over and over,  all I heard was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You make me Brave,  wanna be stronger BRAVE, wanna be bolder BRAVE....</em></p>
<p>That was our summer anthem. I have videos of my then 6 and 2 year olds belting out these words. It was sweet.</p>
<p>Then,  something horrible happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> On September 1, 2014, my husband, my daughters' daddy, our best friend, went to live with Jesus.</p>
<p>It's funny how you can listen to a song 5 million times, and never actually HEAR it until you need it.  See, the opening line of the song says<em> "No one told me this would be easy,  but I never knew that it would be this hard.  Oh the worry is weighing on me.  Would you help me break down all these question marks and make me Brave."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Crazy huh?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Never heard<em> those </em>lyrics before<em>. </em></p>
<p> I bawled. Then I got it.  God had been preparing us. He used this song that<em> (if I'm being honest)</em> was beginning to annoy the snot out of me, to teach me that I wasn't alone. When I actually listened to the lyrics,  I heard that God knew how hard this was gonna be for me and for my children, but that <strong>He </strong>would equip us with what we needed to move forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Funny how a song from a person I only knew from her album cover could convey so much!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I let Leah help with the playlist at her Daddy's celebration of life and, along with For King &amp; Country's <em>Fix My Eyes</em> and Moriah's version of <em>Give Me Jesus</em>, <em>Brave</em> was at the top of her list. It played in rotation during the pre-service encouraging me and reminding me that we'd be ok.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My daughter may not quite get it now,  but one day she'll understand the impact this song and artist had on her summer and healing. AND last night, I was able to (very briefly) share a tidbit of how God used her in our story with the artist who spoke God's promise to my family through her song!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How cool is that?!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wanna know something even more awesome?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>God's timing</strong>, that's what!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> This week marks 2 years since we lost Jay.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Coincidence? I think not?</p>

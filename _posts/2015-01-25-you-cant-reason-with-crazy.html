<p style="text-align: center;">Last night, my friend was trying to talk my almost 3 year old into sleeping in her own bed. They went back and forth for a while before I interveined. <em>"You can't reason with crazy"</em> I informed my friend. (My sister coined this phrase earlier in the week and I LOVE it!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yes, LuLu is a child. I get that she doesn't understand. However, this phrase applies perfectly to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She's crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What sane person jumps on a wet bed after they've been told it's not water, but pee? They don't!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who hugs a dog so tight that the dog has to snarl and nip at them to be let go? That would be a CRAZY person.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">That's my LuLu.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> She just does whatever is on her little mind whenever it appears. No form of punishment detours her. Once she's committed, it will be done. Watch out if she's running towards you, chances are your about to be her next victim. She's only 25lbs but the kid is all strength and doesn't realize it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> However, she's also very loving and compassionate. She's the first one to run up to a crying child, put her hands on her knees and ask "what's wrong buddy?" Sometimes she's what caused the child to cry, but she still didn't like to see anyone sad. She's constantly asking LK and I if we're happy and she gives hugs "so you won't be crazy no more."  (I may or may not use the phrase "you're making me crazy" a little too much...)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I love her.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's probably the only person in this world who drives me nuts and makes me laugh uncontrollably at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's so much like her daddy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She terrifies me with her fearlessness. She believes she's invensable. She carries her emotions on her sleeve and you can tell what she's thinking just by the look on her face. She's fantastically animated. She's easily excited and will go on for days about the smallest things. Her smile can make even the worst of days better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most days, she makes me question my sanity, but I'm so blessed to be her momma. She keeps Leah and I on our toes and makes life so much more interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After Jayson died, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to handle her and her spirited attitude. I understand now that her sweet and sassy spirit is a huge part of what gets me through the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's my LuLu and I think I'll keep her, crazy and all.</p>

<p>I was getting take out at a Mexican place down the road when I noticed a cute little plush puppy with maracas and a sombrero. The five-year old in me came out and all I wanted to do was press the button that made him sing, or whatever it was that he did.</p>
<p>He was begging to be heard, but there were a ton of people standing around. If I pressed that button it's certain everyone would stare at this lone woman in the pink hoodie standing by the musical children's toy.</p>
<p>They'd probably all think I was nuts.</p>
<p>What would possess a grown woman to do such a thing?</p>
<p>All the while, little Cami (that's what I named it) was staring me in the face. Push my button! I wanna sing! I need to dance!</p>
<p>So, I did.</p>
<p>I set him free. Then, I grabbed my food and ran out the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got me to thinking about how easily we dismiss one another because of how it may inconvenience us or how others will view us.</p>
<p>Who cares what anyone else thinks? We run around, day-to-day collecting dots and stars (You should read You Are Special by Max Lucado if you're confused). We base our worth on the opinions of others when really, if we just devote ourselves to our maker, their stickers won't stick. The world can try all day long to convince you who you should be, but who's opinion means more?</p>
<p>I smile at people. I'm pleasant, most of the time. I don't do these things for gratitude or to impress, I do them because I know first hand that <strong><em>you never know what someone else is going through. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You may never know what a huge impact your smile and kind words can make. </em></strong></p>
<p>That woman who just yelled at you in your office may have just received some bad news and she doesn't know how else to react. She may just need someone to love her through her anger and she may just come back a few days later and thank you for your kindness, even though she didn't deserve it.</p>
<p>Everyone deserves to be noticed.</p>
<p>When my daughters say my name over and over and over again, they just want to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Humor that crazy woman in the grocery store who strikes up a conversation while looking at toothbrushes. It may just be the only adult interaction she's had all day (true story).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cami the maracan shaking dog was glad to be noticed, to be acknowledged and to be set free to share his joy. I'm glad I pushed the button. Everyone stopped and stared, but for a brief second before I darted, his cute little dance made me smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*<em>Thanks for humoring my silly little rant. Obviously, I don't get out much these days and it doesn't take much to get my brain going.</em></p>

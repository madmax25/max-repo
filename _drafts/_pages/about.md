**HELLO ALL and WELCOME TO MY BLOG**

I’m a mommy to 2 beautiful little ladies, a daughter, a friend, an optical lab tech, a follower of Jesus Christ and a widow, amongst other things. The Lord called my Jayson home, unexpectedly, in September of 2014. I won’t allow this to be a stumbling block, however and see it as an opportunity to teach my children about facing adversity with grace and perseverance while remembering that GOD ALWAYS KNOWS what He is doing. We may have lost our best friend, love and Daddy, but we are gonna move forward the best we possibly can to honor his memory.

I’m an open book and can see the beauty as well as humor in everyday, ordinary things.

I’m a FRIENDS fanatic and can compare any situation to an episode of it.

I have the absolute best family and friends in the entire world.

and

My kids are pretty awesome (even though they are a bit crazy….)!

Thanks for stopping by to read about our crazy adventures, sorrows and my rants as well.

Hope this blog can bring you some encouragement and please feel free to comment or contact me!

Kelly

<p style="text-align: center;">My  youngest child is named after the Yellow Samurai Power Ranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You may think this is a story, but it's not. She was named by her 3 year old sister (at the time Leah was 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jayson and I liked the idea of getting Leah involved in the naming of the baby when I was pregnant. She came up with a plethora of interesting names: Blue, Purple Dinosaur, Brittany (?), Green Baby Dinosaur... Anyway, we totally weren't looking to use any of these names, but she really liked being involved. One morning, before we knew the sex of the baby, Leah crawled in bed with me and we were having one of our famous morning conversations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Mommy, God told me I was gonna have a baby sister and He said her name would be Emily."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Like the Power Ranger?" I asked</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Yes," she said "She'll be the yellow ranger cause she's my favorite."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well, low and behold the kid was correct and we had a baby sister. Jayson and I had already settled on Lauren, so Emily became her middle name.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who were we to argue with what God told our 3 year old?</p>

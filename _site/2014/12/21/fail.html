<p>There was a day, not long ago, when my kids were angels. Everyone said please and thank you, they played together all day and never argued, no one broke anything, spilled their drink in my new car and they ate exactly what I gave them. That day, I went to the grocery store and ran all my errands with no meltdowns and no one looked at me like I was the worst mother in the store because there was no reason for it. We all got along, no one got their feelings hurt and everything went according to plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Haha! Are you kidding me? Sounds great though, huh?</p>
<p>I dream of the day I don't do something to damage my girls. I have an interesting sense of humor. The girls and I were out shopping with my SIL the other day at Kohl's and for some reason, my LuLu was mesmerized by every thing Pluto (Mickey's dog, not the once planet) she saw. It was really quite adorable. That same trip, LK carried a Lego book around and was enthralled with it. She loves to read. When we were checking out, I told her I wasn't buying it (little did she know, I did and it's under the tree). She told me I always say no to everything, so I said yes to the stuffed Pluto LuLu was loving on. LK didn't realize I let her have it until we got to the car.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"That's not fair!" She cried. "Why does LuLu get something and I don't?"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I said the first thing that popped into my head:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"It's because she's cuter than you". (I thought my SIL was gonna drop my youngest from shock)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>LK was semi in shock. I let that sink into her 6-year-old brain while I buckled her in.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Is LuLu really cuter than me?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Well look at her sweetie.</em><em>She's just downright adorable! But, you're my favorite," I whispered into her ear as a big ole cheesy grin appeared on her face.</em></p>
<p><em>"But, I'm still cute though, right?"</em></p>
<p><em>"You are, but I can only have one cute one and one favorite. I'm not allowed to make one both and even if I did, I couldn't tell you."</em></p>
<p><em>"It's me, they both yelled."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It was fun. Weeks later, I'm still using the cute one and favorite one as names for them. It annoys LK, but I figure whatever I'm doing to screw them up, therapy will fix, eventually.</p>
<p>So, for all of you competing for Momma of the Year, good luck with that. I'll be that mom in the grocery with the screaming kids, pinching one another and making a scene. Try not to be jealous of my awesomeness and remember, <strong>We all have mom fails EVERYDAY, but as long as you are raising them the way God has instructed </strong>(and they're still breathing)<strong> you are doing a great job! </strong></p>
<p><strong> Give yourself a pat on the back and some grace. </strong></p>

  Thank You Brad Paisley
  
    <small>31 Dec 2014</small>
  
</h2>

<p>My love affair with Brad Paisley began in my Senior year of high school. I was a hopeless romantic and would daydream about him singing to me and only me. There was just something about his voice. I've never swooned over a celebrity, but he's one that may just leave me speechless if we ever met.</p>

<p>Jayson knew this when we met. He knew early in our relationship that I would leave him for Brad Paisley if ever the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>In college, Jayson worked for a security firm in Nashville. He was somewhat of a veteran there, so he was put in the best spots. Every year he worked backstage at the CMA's and he was never afraid to speak to any of the artists. Many of them remembered him from year to year and J was always impressed by that.</p>
<p>One particular year, very early in our relationship, he was backstage when he ran into..... Brad Paisley. A lesser man would've done something like pour dish detergent in his drink so bubbles would come out when he sang (Little Rascals reference). Not my J. With no jealousy or worry at all, he walked right up to Brad Paisley and said, <em>"Mr Paisley, my girlfriend just loves you. She swears she's gonna marry you one day."</em></p>
<p>Brad Paisley then said the words that forever changed my life:</p>
<p><em>"No. Tell her she's supposed to marry you."</em></p>
<p>So there it is folks. I owe Brad Paisley a big thank you for contributing to the best ten years of my life.</p>
<p>Jayson probably still would have asked me to marry him and I still probably would have said yes, however, it's always been a wonderful story to tell. I married my husband because Brad Paisley said so and it was the most wonderful advice ever given so, thank you Brad Paisley!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff99cc;"><em>*On a side note, I'm not a crazy stalker Mr Paisley. So, if you ever read this and wanna hook me up with tickets to a concert and maybe some meet and greet passes, I promise to be completely normal and chill. Also, our kids are about the same age and mine are available for play dates anytime!</em></span></h4>

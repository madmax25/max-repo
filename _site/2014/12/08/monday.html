<p>Monday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/done.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-115 size-full" src="/max-repo/assets/done.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To say I am displeased with this day is an understatement. Monday is that day I have to wake up before my children if I want a shower. Monday starts the week in which I will have to drag my oldest out of bed, physically dress her myself after threatening to send her to school in her jammies, frantically get out the door to get her to school on time (without breakfast) and maybe her teeth and hair were brushed. I don't know, but I know this truancy thing is serious business and some days I think my daughter wants me to spend some time in the slammer just so she can sleep in. That's Monday folks.</p>
<p>Every Monday morning I start my healthy eating campaign. <em>"No Chick Fil-a this week"</em>  I'll tell myself. <em>HA!</em> After dragging a child out of bed and making sure she at least looks like someone loves her, who has time for breakfast at home? My waist line hates me. But, the girl at the drive thru LOVES my glasses and knows my order. She could be my newest best friend.</p>
<p>Monday is also that day that people are gonna say things to me that make me want to poke them in the eye. For example, one Monday a few weeks ago, my girls were being particularly spirited while trying to get in the car after school. I had a moment and raised my voice (Southern woman don't yell. We raise our voice) as another mother was passing by with her perfect angels. <em>"I have a copy of (insert parenting unruly children book title here). Looks like you can use it!"</em> <strong>GRRRR</strong>. In my head I instructed that mother, very kindly, where she could put that book and that what I really needed was for my husband not to be dead. However, in real life, I just kept my back turned and continued buckling my children into their seats. Thank you kind woman for being so encouraging.</p>
<p>Mostly, I loathe Monday because it took my husband.</p>
<p>However, there are some truths about Monday that I have to share. Every Monday I am privileged to wake up with 2 precious loves snuggled up against me. Monday is the beginning of my work week and I adore my job and the women I get to do life with there. Monday was my last glorious day spent with my J. Monday was the day of our last kiss. It was the day of our last good morning and our final goodbye. Monday is a good day. Monday did not take my husband. Cancer and a worn out body did. Monday was the day I realized just how much <strong>God loves me</strong>. He showed me just how <strong>strong I really am</strong>. Monday is the day God revealed just how much <strong>the people in my life really care</strong>. Monday was the day I knew everything would be ok. Monday was the day I changed the way I see God. It changed our relationship. I'm not sure just how yet, but I'm sure it will be revealed in time.</p>
<p>Oh, and someone paid for my meal at Chick Fil-a this morning. Monday, you are redeemed.</p>
<p>Happy Monday!</p>

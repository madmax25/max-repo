<p>As I lay here attempting to sleep, these are the things running through my head:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>LuLu poured water in MY bed right where I lay! Great... </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Why won't my children sleep in their own beds? "Your feet do not belong on your sister's head!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Who ate a pop tart in my bed?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Stop picking your nose and wiping it on your sister!"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> I haven't washed my hair in a week! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Mom! Lauren just put a booger on me!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It is 10:00pm! Why are my children still awake?!?! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Lauren just bit me!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It's 32° outside. Why won't my dog come in? (Probably because she knows she'll sleep better outside where no one's flicking boogers on anyone. Seriously, am I raising monkeys?) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Why is she talking to herself? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I roll over to find my youngest "counting" her toes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> "I got this one and this one and that one and this one."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then it hits me as I stared into her sweet little eyes. They are all I have left of their daddy. These girls are him. I no longer get to fall asleep next to my best friend, but at least I have our babies. I may get flustered and sometimes hug them a little to tight to keep from pulling my own hair out, but I wouldn't have them any other way. I may think I want my bed back, but the truth is, it's comforting for all of us.  Who cares if they sleep with me until they leave for college? Right?... I believe we all need this bit of extra security right now and one day I'll wish for this back. So, for now I'll take the biting and boogers along with the giggles and snuggles. And, if I'm lucky, one day maybe I'll get some sleep again. Good night all!</p>

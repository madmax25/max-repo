<p>Some of you may find this surprising, but I used to be a bit high-strung and somewhat snotty. So much, in fact, that 2 of my dearest friends, let's call them Brenda and Vanessa, did not like me. "Brenda" has been quoted saying that if you would have told her 10 years ago that she and I would be the best of friends, that she wouldn't have believed it. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have either. We were all in a small group together that my husband drug me to every week. Everyone loved him. They tolerated me. I was stuffy and tried to be prim and proper. They all liked to have fun and were way more outgoing than I was. That small group didn't last long after they cancelled one night and forgot to tell me. I stood on the front porch and watched our small group leader leave his house. He drove right past me and MY CAR sitting in front of his house and never stopped. Man, I really felt the love.</p>
<p>Somehow, J and I again ended up in a couples small group with the same 2 women and their husbands. (Different leader this time, THANK GOODNESS). They would plan outings and I would attempt to invite myself along. Somehow, eventually we all became friends and more people joined our group. We all sat together at church, had lunch at the same Chinese restaurant every Sunday, then were still excited to see one another and catch up Monday evening at group. It was as if we had a second family.Over the years, most of us have started families, some have moved churches and a couple of friends have moved away. But, one thing has always stayed constant, our unwavering love for one another.</p>
<p>When J was diagnosed with his 2nd tumor in June, we were devastated. These were the friends we turned to. They threw a party the weekend before his surgery just so we could be together for fellowship and prayer. He took part in the Ice Bucket challenge that night and danced a little penguin jig while we all laughed. When he was in surgery, they were there. Not everyone could be there physically, but the calls and texts proved that they wanted to be. When he took a turn for the worst, friends drove through the night to be by his side. When he died, they were there to hold my hand, offer encouragement and hold me at 2am when I completely lost it. You know you have a true friend when she instructs you how to breathe when you feel like you've forgotten.</p>

<br>My girls on the worst day of my life. This was taken that afternoon before J passed away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so thankful that God made these people apart of my life. They have been there through the best and worst of days. Most people can't say they have 1 best friend. I have a community of believers by my side, encouraging me, helping me raise my children and loving us through the worst season we have yet to face. It is the best gift my husband could have ever given me and I'm glad I  broke out of my shell and accepted it.</p>

<br>This was taken the day after J’s Memorial Service. These are my people (minus a few).</p>

<br>Sunday after Church at Chuy’s. The Chinese restaurant couldn’t hold us all.</p>

<br>This year’s Christmas party. We opted for low-key. Someone’s presence was sorely missed, but he would have been angry if we broke tradition.</p>

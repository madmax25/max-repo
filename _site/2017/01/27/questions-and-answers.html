<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Do you ever think you'll get remarried?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Are you dating?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Are you gonna date?"</em></p>
<p>It seems like from the second I became a widow people started asking those questions.</p>
<p>Honestly, Â I found them completely rude and inconsiderate for a very long time. That is not a subject to bring up to someone who has just lost their best friend. However, Â it has been 2 and a half years, Â so here's some thoughts on the matter:</p>
<p>It's my life. Â I'll share what I see fit when I want to share it. Â That's not meant to be ugly in the least, Â it's just exhausting to field those questions from my children let alone every well meaning person who knows our situation.</p>
<p>Yep, my girls even ask.</p>
<p>All the time actually.</p>
<p>They wanna know if God is gonna bring them another daddy. Not one to replace their daddy in heaven, but one who can be a physical daddy here. One that they can see and hear and hug. One that will not die while they are little. A daddy like other kids have. It's not fair that other kids have daddy's and their's is in heaven.</p>
<p>Those are all their words, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>It breaks my heart.Â </strong></p>
<p>They had something so <strong><em>extraordinary</em></strong> that they long to have it again. I know that we had someone so wonderful that no one could ever fill his shoes.</p>
<p>So, Â here's my honest to God thoughts on dating and marriage to all you who are on the edge of your seats, Â biting your nails and awaiting some great wisdom.</p>
<p>In cases such as mine, I don't believe in soul mates. I believe God sends us people who will make us better just for knowing them. I believe that not everyone is meant to be in your life forever. Â I believe that God has got my life in his hands and if there is someone out there for me and my girls that he'll show up in our lives when he shows up. I'm in no rush and I'm certainly not looking.</p>
<p>Besides, I'm at the gym 3 days a week (I'm actually on a treadmill as I'm composing this), school/work 2 days, dance class 2, gymnastics 2, soccer 3 and at church related functions at least 3 days every week. That's way more than 7 days a week. Mr "Future Dad/Husband" better show up at one of those places if he wants to catch me. ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>So, Â if you know someone who's lost their spouse or divorced, don't ask them when they think they'll be ready to date again. Â I promise you, Â it's probably the last thing on their mind. If it's in the cards for them, Â it'll happen when it happens and when they are face to face with the right person.</p>

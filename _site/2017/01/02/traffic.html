<p>My world is very loud these days.</p>
<p>Whether it's from a television, a radio, children.... There's always noise.  There's laughter, crying, lots of whining, but not much silence.</p>
<p>Even in the silence,  my brain can't shut off. <em>"What should we do? Will LuLu get through a whole day without a meltdown? Will the playroom EVER be clean?"</em></p>
<p>Then there's the questions and thoughts about my life. <em> "Am I living the life God wants for me? Tomorrow I will eat healthier. I will lose the weight I've gained, but do I really care?  Will I continue to be lonely?  I'm happy, but could I be happier?  Do I really want to bring someone into our lives?  God, just point me in a direction please. I just don't even know where to begin."</em></p>
<p>Even silence is deafening.</p>
<p>My ears will start ringing as the thoughts just keep flowing.  It helps to write them down,  but they spew out faster than I can think to grab a pen. Then, once I do, they're gone and I can't remember what I wanted to write.</p>
<p>I believe I have a best seller in my head,  but it just gets jumbled up with everyday noise.</p>
<p>The times I do slow my thoughts down enough to pen them,  I don't want to share. I know I have a God given talent when it comes to writing and I want to help others struggling with similar circumstances.  However,  sharing my thoughts makes me more vulnerable to my already close knit community.</p>
<p>Just because I write about it today,  doesn't mean I want to talk about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>It just means that now, at this precise second,  these thoughts need to be released and once they are<em><strong> I'm free</strong></em>.  Free from the noise they are making in my brain.  It's just one more traffic jam in my head that's clearing up.  The ringing slows and,  for a minute,  there's silence.</p>
<p>Until the next thought, that is.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The world is all a buzz about this stupid dress. Is it blue and black or white and gold?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Wanna know my opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think it's a distraction from something bigger. Someone's attempting to cover up a bigger issue by spreading this silly debate across the country. Or maybe not. Maybe it's just a silly debate that's caught on like wild fire. Who knows?</p>
<p>My brain automatically sees it as a cover up or a government conspiracy.</p>
<p>See, my Jayson was one of those and I think his skepticism rubbed off on me a bit. He was ready for the apocalypse, government takeover, the zombies, ect. He "trained" with a group of men one weekend a month in the art of all things tactical. He learned first responder techniques (and frequently practiced them on the girls and I), he had enough ammo to pay off our house (maybe), and spent evenings cleaning his guns and showing our daughter proper care and caution of firearms from the time she was about 4. He also had a "bug out" plan. In the event of a  government take over, we were to leave town with friends and head to an undisclosed location where we'd be safe. He did not, however, stockpile drums of MRE's and flares, which he always reminded me we needed. He also insisted I learned to shoot even though I fought it.</p>
<p>I remember one particular conversation when I asked why he thought all this was necessary. He wanted to be prepared for the days of tribulations after the rapture if it came in our lifetime. I told him I was planning to be called home at that time. He was just planning on being left behind to help nonbelievers believe and fight with the Lords army.</p>
<p>He was a much better person than I. But, that was J,  always willing to stand up for those in need and always happy to share his faith. He lead more people to Christ just because he genuinely cared. That was his life's purpose. I find that pretty amazing. He was a good man. I miss him and all his crazy theories.</p>
<p>And, for the record, I'm pretty sure he would have seen the dress as black and blue.</p>

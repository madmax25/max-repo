<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Do you ever think you'll get remarried?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Are you dating?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Are you gonna date?"</em></p>
<p>It seems like from the second I became a widow people started asking those questions.</p>
<p>Honestly,  I found them completely rude and inconsiderate for a very long time. That is not a subject to bring up to someone who has just lost their best friend. However,  it has been 2 and a half years,  so here's some thoughts on the matter:</p>
<p>It's my life.  I'll share what I see fit when I want to share it.  That's not meant to be ugly in the least,  it's just exhausting to field those questions from my children let alone every well meaning person who knows our situation.</p>
<p>Yep, my girls even ask.</p>
<p>All the time actually.</p>
<p>They wanna know if God is gonna bring them another daddy. Not one to replace their daddy in heaven, but one who can be a physical daddy here. One that they can see and hear and hug. One that will not die while they are little. A daddy like other kids have. It's not fair that other kids have daddy's and their's is in heaven.</p>
<p>Those are all their words, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>It breaks my heart. </strong></p>
<p>They had something so <strong><em>extraordinary</em></strong> that they long to have it again. I know that we had someone so wonderful that no one could ever fill his shoes.</p>
<p>So,  here's my honest to God thoughts on dating and marriage to all you who are on the edge of your seats,  biting your nails and awaiting some great wisdom.</p>
<p>In cases such as mine, I don't believe in soul mates. I believe God sends us people who will make us better just for knowing them. I believe that not everyone is meant to be in your life forever.  I believe that God has got my life in his hands and if there is someone out there for me and my girls that he'll show up in our lives when he shows up. I'm in no rush and I'm certainly not looking.</p>
<p>Besides, I'm at the gym 3 days a week (I'm actually on a treadmill as I'm composing this), school/work 2 days, dance class 2, gymnastics 2, soccer 3 and at church related functions at least 3 days every week. That's way more than 7 days a week. Mr "Future Dad/Husband" better show up at one of those places if he wants to catch me. 😉</p>
<p>So,  if you know someone who's lost their spouse or divorced, don't ask them when they think they'll be ready to date again.  I promise you,  it's probably the last thing on their mind. If it's in the cards for them,  it'll happen when it happens and when they are face to face with the right person.</p>

			<p><p>My world is very loud these days.</p>
<p>Whether it's from a television, a radio, children.... There's always noise.  There's laughter, crying, lots of whining, but not much silence.</p>
<p>Even in the silence,  my brain can't shut off. <em>"What should we do? Will LuLu get through a whole day without a meltdown? Will the playroom EVER be clean?"</em></p>
<p>Then there's the questions and thoughts about my life. <em> "Am I living the life God wants for me? Tomorrow I will eat healthier. I will lose the weight I've gained, but do I really care?  Will I continue to be lonely?  I'm happy, but could I be happier?  Do I really want to bring someone into our lives?  God, just point me in a direction please. I just don't even know where to begin."</em></p>
<p>Even silence is deafening.</p>
<p>My ears will start ringing as the thoughts just keep flowing.  It helps to write them down,  but they spew out faster than I can think to grab a pen. Then, once I do, they're gone and I can't remember what I wanted to write.</p>
<p>I believe I have a best seller in my head,  but it just gets jumbled up with everyday noise.</p>
<p>The times I do slow my thoughts down enough to pen them,  I don't want to share. I know I have a God given talent when it comes to writing and I want to help others struggling with similar circumstances.  However,  sharing my thoughts makes me more vulnerable to my already close knit community.</p>
<p>Just because I write about it today,  doesn't mean I want to talk about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>It just means that now, at this precise second,  these thoughts need to be released and once they are<em><strong> I'm free</strong></em>.  Free from the noise they are making in my brain.  It's just one more traffic jam in my head that's clearing up.  The ringing slows and,  for a minute,  there's silence.</p>
<p>Until the next thought, that is.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MORIAHPETERS.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-428 aligncenter" src="/max-repo/assets/MORIAHPETERS-300x300.jpg" alt="My daughter and I with her fav! " width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This is Moriah Peters.</p>
<p>She is probably,  without a doubt,  my daughters favorite singer.  Last night,  she FINALLY got to meet her. We've attempted to talk to her the last 3 times we were in the same building and it's for more than just a photo op.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So,  in the summer of 2014 I called into a radio show,  gave the phone to LK, and she won a contest.  Her prize?  Moriah Peters' CD, <em>Brave</em>. That summer,  we listened to the title track on repeat.  Over and over and over and over,  all I heard was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You make me Brave,  wanna be stronger BRAVE, wanna be bolder BRAVE....</em></p>
<p>That was our summer anthem. I have videos of my then 6 and 2 year olds belting out these words. It was sweet.</p>
<p>Then,  something horrible happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> On September 1, 2014, my husband, my daughters' daddy, our best friend, went to live with Jesus.</p>
<p>It's funny how you can listen to a song 5 million times, and never actually HEAR it until you need it.  See, the opening line of the song says<em> "No one told me this would be easy,  but I never knew that it would be this hard.  Oh the worry is weighing on me.  Would you help me break down all these question marks and make me Brave."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Crazy huh?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Never heard<em> those </em>lyrics before<em>. </em></p>
<p> I bawled. Then I got it.  God had been preparing us. He used this song that<em> (if I'm being honest)</em> was beginning to annoy the snot out of me, to teach me that I wasn't alone. When I actually listened to the lyrics,  I heard that God knew how hard this was gonna be for me and for my children, but that <strong>He </strong>would equip us with what we needed to move forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Funny how a song from a person I only knew from her album cover could convey so much!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I let Leah help with the playlist at her Daddy's celebration of life and, along with For King &amp; Country's <em>Fix My Eyes</em> and Moriah's version of <em>Give Me Jesus</em>, <em>Brave</em> was at the top of her list. It played in rotation during the pre-service encouraging me and reminding me that we'd be ok.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My daughter may not quite get it now,  but one day she'll understand the impact this song and artist had on her summer and healing. AND last night, I was able to (very briefly) share a tidbit of how God used her in our story with the artist who spoke God's promise to my family through her song!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How cool is that?!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wanna know something even more awesome?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>God's timing</strong>, that's what!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> This week marks 2 years since we lost Jay.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Coincidence? I think not?</p>

			<p><p>Ever have one of those days when you're perfectly fine? You get up, get the kids to school, have a perfectly normal day at work, then <em><strong>BAM</strong></em>!, out of nowhere you have an anxiety attack driving back to the office after lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>That happens to everyone, right?</em></p>
<p>You get the urge to scream, but you can't and you don't know why. You've been fine. Sure, life isn't all you've ever dreamed, but you're managing. Or, are you? <em>BOOM</em>! In sneaks all your insecurities, all your fears, all the conversations you've had with your children where you were perfectly level headed, until that drive back to the office. Now you're all alone and your thoughts can get the best of you.</p>
<p>The night before, your 7 year old tells you someone told her that one day, Jesus would come back and bring her Daddy back with him. She is very confused by this. You try to clarify, but all your 3 year old hears is that Jesus is bringing daddy home. She proceeds to jump up and down on the bed exclaiming how she can't wait and how she hopes it's tomorrow. No amount of explaining can convince her that her Daddy won't be coming home tomorrow.</p>
<p>You cry yourself to sleep.</p>
<p>Your alarm goes off. You don't know what day it is. You struggle to get out of bed 45 minutes later, yet still have a great morning with your children and everyone gets to where they need to be in great spirits.</p>
<p>You interact with people all morning. Work is hectic, your office is a bit disheveled from being so busy, but your fine despite the crazy. In fact, the crazy is keeping you sane! The less you can think about home, your kids, yourself the better. But, that didn't last forever.</p>
<p>Images of that precious baby, bouncing on your bed in excitement creep in when you're alone. And that, my friends, is what causes you to cry so hard in your car that an hour later your eyes still burn.</p>
<p>Just a typical day in the life of the grieving. They're not all like this, but they want to be. See, it's never ending. You hear a girl yell out Daddy and turn to see an embrace that your children don't get. It's unfair. Death is unfair. Being a single mom is unfair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Life is unfair.</strong></em></p>
<p>Listening to other people complain about petty things makes you wanna explode. Stop complaining and do something!</p>
<p>You just don't get it unless you've been there. Don't tell someone who's grieving to "<em>get over it</em>" or "<em>time heals</em>" because it doesn't work that way. You never get over it, you learn to live with the pain and the healing part, well that depends on the day. When you lose a part of you, it causes you to rethink everything about yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Who are you? What do you do now?</em></p>
<p>The answers to those questions depend solely on you. As much as you want someone else to take the wheel, you are ultimately in control of your actions. <strong>No one can, nor should they, tell you how you should be.</strong></p>
<p>As for me? Most days I'm fine. I get by. But, I never know when that MACK truck of emotion is going slam into me and make me a basket case. I hate it, but I've come to terms with it. Life is what it is. You just have to take it minute by minute and know that, one day, that "<em><strong>BAM</strong></em>" moment might just be a good surprise.</p>

		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p>11 months today (not today, today. August 1st), around 10pm, my Jayson took his last breath. The support that followed from family, friends and even complete strangers was something I never could've dreamt of. From cleaning my house and taking care of my children to making sure we were fed, our community took care of our every need.</p>
<p>Then, the mailbox started to fill up with letters and cards. Flowers filled my home. They were kind gestures, but I resented them. Most of the plants, I gave away. The cards were thrown in a box, never again to see the light of day, or so I thought.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with a friend, she asked if I had read the cards yet. <strong><em>Of course not</em></strong>! I hadn't given them a second thought since the majority of them were thrown across my home in fits of anger, then eventually, placed in a box for safe keeping because I did appreciate that people cared enough to send one.</p>
<p>Her question peeked my curiosity.</p>
<p>I couldn't remember who attended his memorial service, let alone those who sent cards and flowers. I can't even remember if I sent thank you cards or even acknowledged receiving anything! That was a dark time and I assume (<em>really, I'm hoping)</em> no one was offended by my lack of gratitude at that time.</p>
<p>I climbed into the top of Jayson's freshly packed up closet and dug out the picture box that held everything that was given to me. There were beautiful poems, bible verses written on slips of paper, cards from the flowers, (<em>that I had no idea I had saved)</em> and an endless sea of envelopes. Way too many to open and read in one sitting. So, I reached in and grabbed just one.</p>
<p>It was from my mom.</p>
<p>I remember looking at it when it was handed to me originally. I did read it, but didn't see the words. I didn't "<em>see</em>" anything at that time. Reading this card reminded me of how much I've missed this past year. I was present, but I was indifferent. Nothing had <em>really</em> made me happy. I hadn't experienced <em>real</em> joy.</p>
<p>Then, at some point a few months ago, something clicked. A fog was lifted and life began again. No more auto pilot. No more "<em>what am I doing</em>." My eyes were opened and I was finally adapting to my "new normal" (I hate that phrase by the way...)</p>
<p>This past weekend, Jayson would have been 33.</p>
<p>I could've just ignored it like I did Father's Day, but that just didn't seem right. This was the day my best friend, my husband, Leah and Lauren's daddy, was born! It truly was a day to celebrate, so we did. I wanted to invite everyone who had been here for us this past year, but my street couldn't hold that many cars. The girls and I rented a water slide, my sister in law filled a pool with water balloons, my girls baked and decorated a cake (on their own), Jayson's mom and sister drove in from New Mexico. We ate good food, laughed and reminisced. The kids were non-stop. It was wonderful!</p>
<p>At the end of the party, we released balloons. During the party, guests wrote messages to J on them. Some were super heartfelt, some were silly inside jokes. We sang Happy Birthday, then sent our birthday greetings to heaven.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_366" align="aligncenter" width="225"]<a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG951318.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-366" src="/max-repo/assets/IMG951318-225x300.jpg" alt="Releasing balloons for Jayson's birthday." width="225" height="300" /></a> Releasing balloons for Jayson's birthday.[/caption]</p>
<p>There were some tears shed. Even some of the <em>manly</em> men couldn't hold them back. It was a beautiful expression of the love so many shared for my husband.</p>
<p>We watched as 30 something balloons floated to him, amazed that they all stayed together. Not one drifted from the others. In hindsight, those balloons were just mimicking what those who released them have learned: <em>You're stronger together then you will ever be alone</em>.</p>

<p>I am so thankful for everyone who has been there for my family, offered kind words, took my girls on play dates, called, sent cards and flowers, showed up on my doorstep, ect. There's no possible way we could have gotten through this past year without you. Thank you all so very much for the blessing of your friendships and mostly, thank you all for your support and never giving up on us!</p>
<p>Thanks for checking in y'all!!!</p>

He had to move home for a semester for a shoulder surgery (<em style="font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">he totally separated his shoulder playing FLAG football!!</em>) and I drove 50 miles each way just to hang out with him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He, however, persued me. I wasn't looking for a boyfriend, nor did I want one. But, Jayson was the kind of person who wouldn't take no for an answer. Eventually, he always got what he wanted. And, although I knew from the moment we met that I would marry him someday, he still had to convince me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's always been hard to get my head and my heart to agree. I'm stubborn. I don't always believe what my heart is trying to tell me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, fast forward 14 years and that fun loving, spirited, stubborn girl is now wiser, a single mom of 2, still fun loving and spirited, but a little broken.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Where do I go from here?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, let me fill you in on a highly guarded secret : I am clueless.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shortly after Jay's death, I feel the Lord opened my eyes and heart to the promise of new possibilities. Although, my head said <em style="font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">"You are crazy. Do you actually believe YOU can find THAT again? You had it, it's gone, deal with the fact you will be alone forever! No one wants your baggage!"</em> I don't feel those are Gods words though. Those are words of fear, words coming from not knowing what's in store and maybe being fearful of the future. It's way easier to shut everyone out and completely live inside yourself then it is to open yourself up to new possibilities, new beginnings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a while I felt extremely guilty. Why was I even allowing myself to think of ever dating again or eventually maybe even falling in love?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I started dreaming of Jay. The dreams were so real that when I woke up, I couldn't see reality. Waking up alone, raising two girls by myself, dealing with everyday issues without him, that was the dream. Those dreams of him by my side made it really hard to cope and even function for that matter. I felt crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I finally got up the nerve to tell one of my girlfriend's and we both prayed for the dreams to stop. Funny, huh. All I've wanted was to have him back, go back in time, but now I'm asking God to take him away.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, the dreams stopped and with them came a sense of relief, but the guilt came sneaking back in. Satan likes to hold things against you. He wants you to be miserable, not God. Guilt for no reason, is not from the Healer, but from the enemy. So, I fought it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm a fighter, so it seems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like I said, I'm still trying to figure out if I really believe what I say that comes from my heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, 2 days ago I dreamt of him again. This dream I knew was a dream, though it was so very real. I went to bed with thoughts of "what ifs" dancing around my brain. "What if I found someone? What would that look like? What would people say? Do I care what people would say? What about my girls? How would that work?" You get the point.... When I finally fell asleep, Jayson was there. He told me I had to let him go. I cried and said no, but he insisted. He said that God was waiting on him and he really wanted to go, so I had to let him. Then, we were at our sitters house (she promised J she'd take care of "his girl's," all of us). He just stood over her for a second, I don't know if he spoke and I couldn't figure out if she even knew he was there, then he climbed a ladder and disappeared.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I woke up with the most peace I've had in a while. I don't know if that was God or J or my subconscious, who knows, but I'd like to think it was God allowing J to reassure me that we will be fine, that I am OK.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I smiled all day. I was giddy with the thoughts of new possibilities, of opening myself up again. I'm not saying I'm looking by any means, but if God presents someone to me, my eyes are open. I can't get my head to agree with that, but my heart says, "why not?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm working on believing what I say. I'm working on listening to my heart. It's been 9 months and I'm still standing, so I guess I'm doing something right. Starting from scratch is scary. It's unpredictable and I'm terrified. However, the possibilities are endless. It's a beginning of a new story and I can't wait to see how it plays out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kelly</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">Our stories make us stronger... All aboard brave souls. We move on, but we never, ever forget.</em></p>

<p>It's here.</p>
<p>FATHER'S DAY.</p>
<p>The day my children are reminded <em>ALL DAY LONG</em> that their daddy is not with them.</p>
<p>This past week has been a very difficult week. We've had meltdowns, angry outbursts, crying for daddy in the middle of the night, and lots of sadness. I did NOT want today to be a continuation of this emotional week. <strong>Jayson was an AMAZING daddy</strong>. His girls adored him with every ounce of their being. He was silly. He loved to pick at them. There has always been way more laughter in our home than there has been tears. I wanted to honor that, not sit around and mope.</p>
<p>So, I made plans. The girls and I were going to spend the day at a water park with family. But, that fell through, so I woke up this morning trying to decide what to do. It didn't have to be something grand, but it had to be fun. I decided to call my mom and take the girls to the new American Girl Store. It was the one place I knew we wouldn't run into lots of daddy's on Father's Day. We skipped church (<em>because, let's face it, making a craft for your father when he's in Heaven is not really all that awesome)</em> and headed off. I made a big deal about getting to look at everything in the store and eating cupcakes with our dolls, Kit and Wild Style (<em>Can you guess who owns Wild Style?).</em> I even told Leah they might be able to get the twin dolls, but we'd have to see.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? You can't get a reservation at a Bistro on the same day. Even if it is Father's Day. I guess other single mom's had the same idea.</p>
<p>I was bummed, but, we were gonna make the best of it. So, we had a lunch of pizza and Japanese in the food court <em>(2 of J's favorites</em>) then started our adventure into American Girl with two 3 year olds, a 7 and 13 year old and 3 adults.</p>
<p>Having never stepped foot in that place, I was in awe! So girlie and fun! They had everything! I'm so glad I had other's with me to help keep an eye on my kids because I was enjoying looking at the dolls and their accessories. I really wanted to get the Girl of the Year, Grace, (<em>for the girl's, of course</em>) but can't just buy one doll for 2 girls.... sadness. Anyway, LuLu tried on dresses in the "Princess Dressing Room" and had to touch everything she saw. Leah wanted it all too and kept trying to talk me into carry bags for her doll and puppies because they need pets! I spent almost as much as I spend on myself for Kit and Wild Style at the Spa. Wild Style really needed it though, her hair was horrific! Kit was pretty with her new braid that Leah meticulously chose. LuLu squealed with excitement as the stylest finished tying ribbons in Wild Style's hair.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/collage_20150622074933309_20150622074943736.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-353" src="/max-repo/assets/collage_20150622074933309_20150622074943736-300x300.jpg" alt="collage_20150622074933309_20150622074943736" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>We hung around the store for what seemed like hours before Leah reminded me I said we could look at the twin dolls. I called Lauren over and they each got to pick their own. Those dolls, although still not cheap, are half the price of the others so I was reasoning with myself in my head that it was ok. I'm pretty frugal. The dolls my girl's have were bought by other people. But, I figured it was ok because this was a special day of sorts.</p>
<p>While reasoning it out in my head and trying to convince myself it was ok, I did something I rarely do in public. I told the sales lady helping us that today was our first Father's Day without daddy, that we lost him in September and that I was just trying to make it a good day for my babies. I don't tell people about my life in random, everyday conversations. I don't want people to feel sorry for us. But, for some reason, I told this random woman at the American Girl store while my girls were picking out their new dolls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Well, the most extraordinary thing happened</strong></em>.</p>
<p>She went to the back as we anxiously awaited our newest babies and came back with not only the babies, but reservations for the Bistro as well! She said that my story touched her so much that she wanted to do something for us, so they arranged for my family to have desserts on <em>THEM</em>! How amazing is that?!? I totally hugged her. I had woken up with the idea of cupcakes with their dolls on Father's Day and this kind lady made it happen!</p>
<p>LuLu was so overjoyed about her pink cupcake and sprinkles that she shared them with her new baby "Pi" (<em>I'm calling her Penelope</em>). Lulu and Pi were both <em>COVERED</em> in pink icing by the time she was through. Wild Style enjoyed some vanilla ice cream. Both dolls were lucky enough to have LuLu lick their faces of the sugary treats while Leah carefully decorated both her cupcakes with perfection before she ate them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/collage_20150622074559823_20150622074612218.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-354" src="/max-repo/assets/collage_20150622074559823_20150622074612218-300x235.jpg" alt="collage_20150622074559823_20150622074612218" width="300" height="235" /></a></p>
<p>It was a wonderful day. I'm so thankful for the kindness that was shown to my family today from everyone we encountered. It was a day filled with laughter, excitement and lots of pink cupcakes. If Jayson can't be here to celebrate with us, I think our adventure today was a great plan B. Father's Day without Daddy wasn't near as sad as I thought it would be. Maybe pink cupcakes at the American Girl Bistro will be our new tradition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Happy Father's Day to all you Dad's out there and also to all you Momma's who are pulling double duty. Try to keep it fun!</em></p>

			<p><p><em>*I wrote this a few weeks back. Just waited a while to post it.*</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Today I did something big.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>People congratulated me and seemed more excited at my accomplishment than I was.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>It was very strange.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>I made 2 ladies cry as I explained how I came to this point. As normal, I kept a straight face and told them it's OK, that the girls and I have adjusted to life without any major complications. That this was all part of God's plan and that we are moving forward.</p>
<p>As I walked out of the bank, I held back my tears. This was a huge deal, but it was so bittersweet not to have Jayson there smiling back at me and say "<em>we finally did it. <strong>We are debt free.</strong>"</em></p>
<p>So, I celebrated,<em> alone</em>.</p>
<p>My shindig included a takeout lunch of a chicken baked potato and a sweet tea. I was gonna splurge on some banana pudding, but they were out. Then my day of putting away mounds of laundry scattered throughout my house was put on the back burner so I could catch up on Once Upon A Time, take a nap and eat way too many Hersey's Nuggets with almonds. That was followed by a rush across town to pick up my girls because I overslept.</p>
<p>I guess you can call that a celebration of sorts, or maybe that's just how I cope.</p>
<p>See, that was the last thing on my list. Jay and I were very prepared for the unthinkable. We discussed, in detail, what we'd do if one of us unexpectedly passed away. We knew who we'd name as beneficiaries, take over raising our kids, had enough life insurance to pay all our debt and then live a comfortably modest life. I told him that I'd want him to find love and be happy. He told me he wanted me to be sad and miserable forever<em>. </em>I laughed. He said he wasn't kidding <em>(he had a great sense of humor)</em>.</p>
<p>I have officially fulfilled my end of the deal. All of it. And, although I miss him dearly, I know he'll always have a huge chunk of me that he took with him. I'm not saying I'm healed, far from it really, but I see now that God has plans for my girls and I that I would have never foreseen. Who knows, as a sweet friend recently said to me, <em>"our husband's could be in heaven looking down and playing match maker."</em> It's a funny thought that makes me giggle every time it crosses my mind.</p>
<p>Now, all I have to do is raise my girls the best I can, try to find some time to figure out who I am now and hope I can clearly hear God's instructions on where to go from here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Easy peasy, right?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><p>Picture this:</p>
<p>You are traveling for the first time by yourself on a plane with two children, 7 and 3. Not only are you worried about them having meltdowns, but you yourself are scared of flying (well, take off and landing).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
First flight is a dream. Smiles, laughter, looks of approval from other passengers. It was glorious!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, your well planned hour and a half layover is in a tiny airport with wall to wall people and no where for the children to run off energy. Not only that, but the little one (<em>who hates to poop and waits until the very last second to tell you she has to go</em>) starts screaming and crossing her ankles. <em>So</em>, off you run to the only bathroom, which by the way, only has 2 stalls and there's 10 people in front of you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What then?</p>
<p>Well, the small child poops her panties and you have the 7 year old hold up a blanket to cover said child while you clean her off and put on a pull up in the middle of the terminal. You clean your hands the best you can with a wipe and try to cover the smell with lotion. The smell doesn't come off your hands though.</p>
<p>Now you are boarding the plane and the 7 year old exclaims she has to pee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Of course she has to pee now! Why wouldn't she have to pee <strong>NOW</strong>?</em></p>
<p>But, you don't have time to run back and wait in line, so you tell her to wait till you get on the plane. However, the plane is packed and she can't get back to the bathroom, so she has to wait until you get in the air.</p>
<p>Can you say <em>turbulence</em>?</p>
<p>Yep, that's right. You are now sitting next to a crying child who can't move because if she does, she'll wet herself. Then the panic sets in her eyes and you are no longer afraid of the wrath of the flight attendant, you run your child to the bathroom only to find the flight attendant sitting by the door and telling you that you're supposed to be seated.</p>
<p>Then, it happens.</p>
<p>You start balling like a baby. Big, ugly sobs. You apologize and try to make an audible apology, but all that comes out is something about <em>just trying to hold it together on your first trip without your husband because he died and she was about to wet herself....</em>He gets up and grabs tissues, you send your child to the potty and here comes your other child running down the aisle.</p>
<p>You cry some more.</p>
<p>You all return to your seats, with the box of tissues because the flight attendant insisted, and you continue to cry.</p>
<p>Your bag is now filled with tissues and the youngest starts screaming she has to poop. <strong>Dear God, let's not repeat this,</strong> you think to yourself. Then you smell the poo and the child knocks her water into the floor soaking the bag under her seat which belongs to someone else. You choose not to tell the bags owner and hope he doesn't notice until you are long gone.</p>
<p>The flight attendant offers you different varieties of adult beverages multiple times. Then your youngest starts screaming like someone's trying to kill her. Flight attendant comes back by to offer you some wine.</p>
<p>You get off the plane with a smelly, sleepy child, frazzled nerves, dirty princess undies in your bag and pretty sure your hand still smells like poo.</p>
<p>You cry again because you are so glad to be off that God forsaken Hell plane. Then you cry some more because you see your late husband's mother and sister on the other side of the terminal.</p>
<p>Everything is much better after that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Laugh if you must, but I totally lived this today on a flight from Kansas City to Albuquerque. Your day doesn't seem so bad now, huh? Good! Glad I can help!</em></p>

			<p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Am I good enough?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Am I strong enough?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Am I wise enough?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Am I <strong>ENOUGH</strong>?</em></p>
<p>Being a single momma is not easy. I'm constantly second guessing my decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><em>"What would Jayson think?"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><em> "How would Jayson handle this?"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's how I've made every decision since he died. It's exhausting trying to be the voice of two people.</p>
<p>So, guess what? I'm done.</p>
<p>I'm going to stop trying to figure out how Jayson would handle things. It doesn't really matter anymore. There are other ways I can honor his memory besides trying to make decisions like him. He and I rarely agreed anyway, but his opinion was always so much stronger than mine that he would win out. I did win on the pink nail polish though.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Every little girl deserves to pick her nail color and hot pink does not make a 2 year old look like a harlet Jayson!"  (That was a real argument....)</em></p>
<p>Even though I feel completely inadequate and lost most of the time, God did equip me with the knowledge to raise my girls. I may have no idea what I'm doing, but He does.</p>
<p>See, all our life together, Jayson and I prayed we would listen to Gods<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> instruction on how to parent our children. He has a plan for every mistake we've already made and the many, many more I'm bound to make on my own.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> So far, both girls are healthy, happy, kind, curious, loving, compassionate and they have Jesus in their heart. I really can't ask for much more than that. I smile when I see them praying for one another and friends that are hurting. Leah has a heart for the homeless and prays that "everybody gets a home and food." That makes me think we've done something right. </span></p>
<p>Am I enough? Alone, no. I'm not.</p>
<p>However, I'm not alone. None of us are. We can choose to ask for and accept help. We can be transparent with our struggles. We can give our fears of inadequacy to our Maker and see them for what they are, <em>lies</em>.</p>
<p><b>I am ENOUGH. </b></p>
<p>It may not always feel that way, but I am.</p>
<p><strong>I am ENOUGH.</strong></p>
<p>I can provide my children a loving, God centered home where they will never want for anything or feel alone.</p>
<p><strong>I am ENOUGH.</strong></p>
<p>I don't always believe it. But I am.</p>
<p><strong>I AM ENOUGH</strong></p>

		</header>
		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p style="text-align: center;">It's 10 o'clock pm and 33 degrees outside.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I'm standing behind my open kitchen door patiently waiting for my big dog to walk through the threshold so I can go to bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My toes are getting numb from the cold.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I decide to shut the door.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I make one last attempt to get her in by hollaring out "it's cold. I know you don't wanna sleep out here!" She looks at me, annoyed. My presence is interrupting her barking at nothing. I shut the door, turn the light out and look through the blinds only to find her sniffing at the door.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">YES! She wants in!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank the Lord. Don't wanna puppy pop in the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So, I open the door. She sticks her head in and duck's right back out in the cold. This goes on for quite some time. Each time I tell her I'm not opposed to allowing her to sleep outside and each time she thinks about coming in, then chooses the cold instead. I only want what's best for her. She has a comfy bed here in her nice warm house, but she chooses the unknown of sleeping out in the cold verses the warmth and security of her home. I wish I could make her come in, but she's 70 lbs of pure muscle and stubborn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Think about that whole silly story for a minute.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It's not just some silly tale about my dog. Although this scenario plays out nightly in my home, it can also serve as an example of our relationship with God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He guides us down certain paths for our lives and we don't always listen when he explains where to go. We are reluctant to rely on God to handle our finances, that job loss, that relationship that needs mending, our pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We can fix it ourself, right? We know better than God!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Haha! WRONG!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">God gave us fee will, but when we live by His will, the choices we make ultimately lead us to the same path. We just get to choose which way to go, the straight and narrow or the windy road? The easy way or the hard way. The funny thing is, the "easy" way can some times be harder. It's not always easy to do the right thing. Is hard to admit your wrong or to forgive someone who hurt you. Those are the very things however, that can bring you closer to what God has in store for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> So, don't be like my dog and sleep out in the cold. Come in and welcome all that is waiting in you.</p>

		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p>Tonight, I beat my punching bag until my knuckles hurt. It didn't help. I tried thinking it was Jayson and I was angry that he left me. But, that didn't make me feel better either. So, I kicked it as hard as I could just to attempt to get the  frustration and pain out. But it didn't work. The pain is still there.</p>
<p>I'm learning that I hate this process.</p>
<p>For months I have been perfectly numb. Yes, I have my bad days, but I have had way more good ones. The numbness was like a bubble of protection shielding me from the brunt of the heartache and for some reason, that stupid bubble decided to pop and let all these emotions just creep up on me unexpected. I'm now, what I've deemed, "weepy."</p>
<p>Everything makes me cry. It sucks.</p>
<p>I have arrived at my second stage of grief: bargaining/guilt.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, there's no set time period or order these stages go in. Tomorrow, I could go right back into denial or being numb, but the sad fact is that I know I have to go through all these stages to process my grief and to be healthy and semi whole again. I may not like it, but I know it's necessary. I fight the feelings of guilt and the what if's that pass through my head and remind myself that I did what I was supposed to do. I didn't do anything wrong. God knew the day and the hour he was going to call Jayson home and nothing I could've done would have stopped it. God's plan is perfect, mine is flawed and no matter what I want or think, it'll never be the other way around.</p>
<p>So, for now I'm weepy. I'm just trying hard to find the joy in everyday life, smile at strangers and not break down in the middle of the grocery store. It's not easy, but what journey is?</p>
<p>Signing off for now,</p>
<p>Weepy, the dwarf who felt too much</p>

But, I can't bring myself to do it. It's a picture of Jayson and I when we first started dating. Smiling, happy, no worries, no one was sick. We were just us, hanging out at a pizza place with my sister. I don't remember much else about that night, but that picture is all the memory I need.</p>
<p>That seems like a lifetime ago.</p>
<p>When I see pictures of Jayson, I feel as if someone else has taken over that life. It's not mine anymore. Did that really happen? Were we really that happy? Did I really lay beside my best friend and the father of my children and feel him take his last breath? Surely that didn't happen. He's just at work. Any minute he'll walk through the door, plop down in his chair and have our babies snuggling with him. Right?</p>
<p>My mind loves to play tricks on me.</p>
<p>It sucks.</p>
<p>I'm constantly reminding myself this is real life. This did happen and I am a strong woman who just continues to move forward. I can do this. J would be amazed by my strength and he would be beaming with pride.</p>
<p>It's funny how looking down at a picture on my phone can spark so much emotion. Maybe I'll leave it. It helps remind me I'm not going crazy. It let's me know my life is real. But, most of all, it reminds me that true happiness and love exists and even if I never find that again, God allowed me to experience it and for that I'm grateful.</p>
<p>Now, I'm late for work and I'm sure the ladies in my office would appreciate me in the building instead of updating my blog from my car. Sometimes, you just have to stop and feel what you feel though. Have a great day y'all and Happy Friday! Sorry if I made you cry.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The world is all a buzz about this stupid dress. Is it blue and black or white and gold?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Wanna know my opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think it's a distraction from something bigger. Someone's attempting to cover up a bigger issue by spreading this silly debate across the country. Or maybe not. Maybe it's just a silly debate that's caught on like wild fire. Who knows?</p>
<p>My brain automatically sees it as a cover up or a government conspiracy.</p>
<p>See, my Jayson was one of those and I think his skepticism rubbed off on me a bit. He was ready for the apocalypse, government takeover, the zombies, ect. He "trained" with a group of men one weekend a month in the art of all things tactical. He learned first responder techniques (and frequently practiced them on the girls and I), he had enough ammo to pay off our house (maybe), and spent evenings cleaning his guns and showing our daughter proper care and caution of firearms from the time she was about 4. He also had a "bug out" plan. In the event of a  government take over, we were to leave town with friends and head to an undisclosed location where we'd be safe. He did not, however, stockpile drums of MRE's and flares, which he always reminded me we needed. He also insisted I learned to shoot even though I fought it.</p>
<p>I remember one particular conversation when I asked why he thought all this was necessary. He wanted to be prepared for the days of tribulations after the rapture if it came in our lifetime. I told him I was planning to be called home at that time. He was just planning on being left behind to help nonbelievers believe and fight with the Lords army.</p>
<p>He was a much better person than I. But, that was J,  always willing to stand up for those in need and always happy to share his faith. He lead more people to Christ just because he genuinely cared. That was his life's purpose. I find that pretty amazing. He was a good man. I miss him and all his crazy theories.</p>
<p>And, for the record, I'm pretty sure he would have seen the dress as black and blue.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-287" src="/max-repo/assets/2015-02-22-19.52.34-197x300.jpg" alt="2015-02-22 19.52.34" width="201" height="306" /></p>
<p>Edit<em>:  The past couple of weeks have been difficult for me.  I've been in pain,  had an unexpected surgery, and just not in the best place emotionally.  Then,  one night I looked up and "Daddy's Star" was shinning brighter than it every has.  Of course I bawled,  but then I smiled.  He's always with us if we just look.  Hope you enjoy reading this, again, because I sure did.  </em>❤❤</p>
<p>The previous owners of our home had an obsession with glow in the dark stars.  They were on the ceiling of every room in the house.</p>
<p>These <em>oh so delightful</em> people left these wonderful decorations when we bought the house from them. They dug up bushes, took down blinds, but left their precious glow in the dark stars <em>(along with about $500 worth of tires in the attic that we happily put on Craigslist.)</em></p>
<p>Anyway, I was 7 months pregnant with Leah when we closed and a dear friend took my over dramatic representation of the state of the house to be fact and sent a cleaning party of around 20 people to my house one cold, January morning.</p>
<p>One particular task that was given to our new Pastor was to walk around and take all the stars down. He served this mundane task with pride and a smile. <em>(There's a pretty good chance he may hate these things after this task.)</em></p>
<p>A week or so later, Jayson and I were settled in our new home. It didn't take long to realize that one star still remained right above our bed, on Jayson's side.</p>
<p>In true Jayson form, he made jokes about it. It was a fun little reminder of having a servants heart and also of the fact that our Pastor was asked to take stars off our ceiling.</p>
<p>When Leah was old enough to notice it, she named it <strong><em>"Daddy's Star."</em> </strong>Anytime she crawled into bed with us she pointed it out. It was special to her. Then Lauren came along and it was a fun game to find <em>"Daddy's Star."</em> We'd climb into our bed and gaze at the ceiling. It's a small star, so your eyes have to adjust just right to see it. The first child to find it would point up and exclaim "<strong><em>There it is! I found daddy's star!"</em></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes J and I would point it out to one another without the girls help. He was fascinated with stars and constellations anyway, so having his own star indoors became an honor. <em>☺(He was a nerd.)</em></p>
<p>Now, it's just me and my girls. They still crawl in my bed and they still make a game out of pointing out daddy's star. That once little annoying decoration has become a wonderful memory. To find <em>"Daddy's star"</em> is now not only an accomplishment, but they find comfort in it. It's simply beautiful how something so silly and ordinary can hold such a strong place in our hearts.</p>
<p>That star being left there was an oversight by our Pastor, but God had a purpose in leaving it there. Every other star is gone but that one has stood strong.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Jay went home to be with the Lord 5 1/2 months ago, but his legacy lives on. We are so blessed by the memories that even the most mundane of things carry. He left us a good life. He left us with family and friends whom he groomed for years to take care of us. He left us knowing we'd be given the strength that only God can give to get us through the darkest moments. His love shines down on us through the stars and back.</p>
<p>His loss has been devastating. But, we know we were meant to be God's shining light. We will burn bright for all to see and smile right back at the star shining down on us.</p>
<p>Hope you all are having a wonderful week!</p>

			<p><p>Here's a fun little weekly post about the crazy life of my girls.</p>
<p>ENJOY!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150206_172302.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-277" src="/max-repo/assets/20150206_172302-169x300.jpg" alt="20150206_172302" width="169" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My  youngest child is named after the Yellow Samurai Power Ranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You may think this is a story, but it's not. She was named by her 3 year old sister (at the time Leah was 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jayson and I liked the idea of getting Leah involved in the naming of the baby when I was pregnant. She came up with a plethora of interesting names: Blue, Purple Dinosaur, Brittany (?), Green Baby Dinosaur... Anyway, we totally weren't looking to use any of these names, but she really liked being involved. One morning, before we knew the sex of the baby, Leah crawled in bed with me and we were having one of our famous morning conversations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Mommy, God told me I was gonna have a baby sister and He said her name would be Emily."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Like the Power Ranger?" I asked</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Yes," she said "She'll be the yellow ranger cause she's my favorite."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well, low and behold the kid was correct and we had a baby sister. Jayson and I had already settled on Lauren, so Emily became her middle name.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who were we to argue with what God told our 3 year old?</p>

		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p style="text-align: center;">Did you ever watch the show Mama's Family? One episode has always stood out to me. Remember the one where they are robbed by the "Cleaning Bandit" and he turned the toilet tissue the "right" way where it's running over the top of the roll? You probably don't, but that stuck with me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Why does it matter?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mama.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-263" src="/max-repo/assets/mama-240x300.jpg" alt="mama" width="240" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Fast forward many, many years to my marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jayson didn't obsess over much. He was perfectly fine with throwing all his clean clothes in a pile on his side of the bed. He'd happily search through said pile daily for clean underwear and matching socks. He never complained (although it drove me nuts). This was totally normal to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When it came to the trash, he had the same motto as in college "he who maketh it topple over, taketh it out." He quickly learned however, that the trash was "man's work" because I refused to change the bag and he would gripe that I stuffed it too full. (I not so secretly did this to get back at him for the clothes.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And then there were dishes. He maybe did the dishes 5-10 times in our entire 10 years of marriage. He wasn't concerned with the state of the sink. There were more pressing matter's to attend to such as swinging a golf club at nothing in the back yard.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You know, the important stuff....</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then, there was the ever present struggle of properly replacing the toilet paper. Now <strong>THAT</strong> got under his skin. He was an "<em>over the top</em>" guy and I am a "<em>just replace the stupid thing</em>" girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tolilet-paper2-e1423770233495.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-265" src="/max-repo/assets/tolilet-paper2-300x195.jpg" alt="tolilet-paper2" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">How we were married 10 whole years is beyond comprehension? But, somehow, we persevered.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If the roll ran out on his watch, he'd replace it the "<em>correct</em>" way. If it ran out on my watch, I'd replace it how it fell, he'd change it, then exclaim through the house "<strong><em>is it really that hard to put the toilet paper on the right way</em></strong>!?"</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was an ongoing struggle filled with internet memes, pictures, jokes and documentaries on properly replacing toilet paper. (Well, actually not that last one. But I did recieve many instructional lectures on the subject.) This was serious business to J. And well, I cared more about annoying him. It was just so much fun to watch him get so riled up over the state of his toilet paper.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Am I mean? Maybe. But it was fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I never understood why this direction of the toilet paper got him so worked up. Maybe it was because he spent so much time in the bathroom. Who knows. I do know, however, that I think about him every time I see a roll of toilet paper the "<em>wrong</em>" way and remember how much it irritated him when I purposely hung it that way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/thTV95S4Y3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-264" src="/max-repo/assets/thTV95S4Y3-300x195.jpg" alt="thTV95S4Y3" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hope this post put a smile on your face and inspires you to be more playful in your relationships and less worried about the silly stuff!</p>

		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p>It's been a week.</p>
<p>I wish I had some positive, funny story to share with you, but I don't.</p>
<p>This week I am heartbroken for more than the normal reasons. I lost a dear friend to cancer this week. She's fought hard against it for 18 months and I guess God was just ready for her struggle to be done. She has been a huge inspiration to me. Her positivity and strength have shown me how to react in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>She really did make lemonaid with her lemons.</p>
<p>She was the first to comfort me when we got Jayson's second tumor diagnoses. She advised me on how to properly Google terms related to his surgery so I wouldn't just see all the doom and gloom, but still stay informed. She held my hand when I cried when though she was facing the same demons. She came to Jayson's memorial service and comforted me still although she could barely stand. She brushed it off as being tired. She was a wonderful friend.</p>
<p>I somehow mustered the courage to attend her funeral. I thought I'd be fine.</p>
<p>I wasn't.</p>
<p>I lasted 10 minutes and had to excuse myself. I found a quiet spot across the parking<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> lot and just sat and cried. It was a wonderful release, but I realized being there was too much. I started  hyperventilating. I was an hour from home, I didn't drive and I didn't know what to do. A coworker found me and just sat with her arms around me until I was able to compose myself. </span></p>
<p>We walked back in and joined the service. It was a beautiful celebration of her life and I made it through the whole thing.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what made me think that wouldn't happen. My husband just died because of the same stupid thing.</p>
<p>I hate cancer.</p>
<p>I hate how it tears families apart. I hate how it ends friendships. I HATE IT.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, I wish I had some profound something to say, but I don't. This is me being angry, bitter and just plain sad.</p>
<p>I'm devastated at the loss of people I love to this horrible beast of a disease. Maybe, one day someone will find a cure. Until then, my prayer for everyone battling it is this: I pray for smiles and strength. I pray God grants you peace and that you know you are loved. I pray you fight the good fight and, if it's your time, I pray you leave a wonderful legacy of memories behind for your family and friends.</p>
<p>Jayson and Heather most definitely did.</p>

		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p>As kids, most of us dreamed about what we wanted to be when we grew up. I wanted to be a fashion model, walking the runways in Paris wearing designer clothes and just being fabulous.</p>
<p>That dream was short lived.</p>
<p>I'm five foot nothing and I like food.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to be on Broadway. I even applied at schools in New York before I realized that I was too practical to chase after something that would never be a sure thing. (I would not be a graceful "starving artist" type.)</p>
<p>So, I went the "practical" route. I enrolled at a school near home and declared my major as Public Relations. I wanted to travel, see the world and meet interesting people. That seemed like the way to do it.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I met J and that all changed. My goals and dreams shifted to make room for our goals and our dreams for our life together. It only seemed reasonable that constant travel would not suffice when we had a family, so my dreams adjusted to fit into our new life.</p>
<p>Jayson always hated when I said that. But, I have never seen it as giving up what I wanted. I believe God changed my heart and allowed me to see a glimpse of what He had in store for my future.</p>
<p>So, for nearly 13 years, every decision I made was with J in mind. What I bought at the grocery. What kind of perfume I wore. What movie we watched. All these things I did with him in mind. He wasn't controlling. He really could care less, actually. I just wanted to make sure he was happy and he did the same for me.</p>
<p>We still had our own interests independent from one another. He played paintball, golfed and camped with his buddies. I liked to read, shop and hang out with my girlfriends. We both had our own identity, but we were one.</p>
<p>Then he died.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When so much of who you are is wrapped up in another for so long, you become lost without them.</p>
<p>I prided myself on being Kelly, <em>Jayson's wife.</em> I fed off his energy and passion. Now I'm Kelly, <em>young widow and single mom</em>. I really don't know this woman at all. She looks like me, but she's different. She has to be. She doesn't have her Jayson anymore.</p>
<p>I'm an introvert by nature, but Jayson helped pull out my fun loving side. I am beginning to find that on my own. I'm starting to discover my new identity.</p>
<p>After J went to be with the Lord, I needed some change so, I got my hair done (something I rarely do BC I'm so frugal). I got a tattoo. I bought new clothes and started planning out ways to redecorate my house. I didn't want to replace Jayson, but so much of what I had always done had been because I was practical. This new Kelly takes risks (after carefully considering what the outcome could be.) She's adventurous and she speaks her mind.</p>
<p>I don't have J to stand behind now, so I have to stand up for myself and my children. I have a sarcastic whit that I've only ever allowed Jayson to see. Some of my friends have really enjoyed this side of me that I've always been a little fearful of. I've learned to say no to the things I don't want to do and to ask for help when I need it. I've learned it's OK to not have all the answers all the time.</p>
<p>I don't immediately recognize myself these days when I look in the mirror, but I like what I see. Through adversity, God has revealed to me a strong woman who can sail past whatever life throws her way. She's not fearless, but knows God is in control and that eases those fears. She attempts to fight her battles with grace and wants to show her children that even though this was never a part of the plan, God will make it for His good.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"She is clothed in strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue."</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em> Proverbs 31:25-26</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thanks y'all!</p>

		</header>
		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p style="text-align: center;">Last night, my friend was trying to talk my almost 3 year old into sleeping in her own bed. They went back and forth for a while before I interveined. <em>"You can't reason with crazy"</em> I informed my friend. (My sister coined this phrase earlier in the week and I LOVE it!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yes, LuLu is a child. I get that she doesn't understand. However, this phrase applies perfectly to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She's crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What sane person jumps on a wet bed after they've been told it's not water, but pee? They don't!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who hugs a dog so tight that the dog has to snarl and nip at them to be let go? That would be a CRAZY person.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">That's my LuLu.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> She just does whatever is on her little mind whenever it appears. No form of punishment detours her. Once she's committed, it will be done. Watch out if she's running towards you, chances are your about to be her next victim. She's only 25lbs but the kid is all strength and doesn't realize it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> However, she's also very loving and compassionate. She's the first one to run up to a crying child, put her hands on her knees and ask "what's wrong buddy?" Sometimes she's what caused the child to cry, but she still didn't like to see anyone sad. She's constantly asking LK and I if we're happy and she gives hugs "so you won't be crazy no more."  (I may or may not use the phrase "you're making me crazy" a little too much...)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I love her.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's probably the only person in this world who drives me nuts and makes me laugh uncontrollably at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's so much like her daddy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She terrifies me with her fearlessness. She believes she's invensable. She carries her emotions on her sleeve and you can tell what she's thinking just by the look on her face. She's fantastically animated. She's easily excited and will go on for days about the smallest things. Her smile can make even the worst of days better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most days, she makes me question my sanity, but I'm so blessed to be her momma. She keeps Leah and I on our toes and makes life so much more interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After Jayson died, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to handle her and her spirited attitude. I understand now that her sweet and sassy spirit is a huge part of what gets me through the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's my LuLu and I think I'll keep her, crazy and all.</p>

			<p><p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes, it's hard to know what to pray for.</p>
<p> I have a dear friend who I've watched battle a very aggressive form of brain cancer for the past 2 years. It hasn't been easy. But, I just knew it would all turn out fine.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't it?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She's young. She's so full of life. She's a great person.</p>
<p> I just got a message saying she's back in the hospital. She had to be put in a medically induced coma to help her body. Jayson had to have that done as well, but he never woke up.</p>
<p>A lady I met at the hospital asked me what I wanted her to pray for. She was conflicted. She has a hard time praying for J to be healed when she knew he was so close to seeing the face of Jesus. I didn't understand why praying for healing was so difficult.</p>
<p>Now I do.</p>
<p>I'm praying for comfort for my friend's family, but how do I pray for her? See, I've lived this already. I remember just <em>knowing</em> in my heart that God would heal my husband. There was no doubt in my mind he would come home with the girls and I. But I walked out of the hospital without J and as much as I want my friend to be healed, I've learned that's not always in God's plan.</p>
<p>I despise this new found knowledge. I want to go back to my bubble where the world is sunshine and roses, where the good guy always wins and where everything turns out great in the end.</p>
<p>Sounds like a cheesy movie, huh?</p>
<p>That's where I lived my life up until September 1, 2014. Then, I learned what it really means to live on a fallen world. A world we weren't meant to be in, where we are separate from God, where there is death and disease and hunger and sin.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be awesome if we could go back and throw a piece of that fruit at Eve? Or better yet, knock said fruit out of her hand and stop her from consuming it. Stupid girl didn't know how good she had it. She had to go ruin it for the rest of us.... I digress.</p>
<p>So, for now, I'll keep praying for comfort for her family and God's will for her. She's a sunshine and roses kind of gal too. She's hanging on for now and fighting the good fight with a smile and joy in her heart.</p>
<p>The world needs more of that.</p>

			<p><p style="text-align: center;">How can one feel alone when surrounded by people?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's a strange concept for most, but when you've lost the person closest to you it's something you experience everyday. No one can understand unless they've been there and those are the last people you want to turn to because no one wants a reminder of that feeling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, how is one supposed to go at this alone?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who do you cry to when the one who comforted you can't?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who do you share your joys, sadness, frustrations with now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who can you tell anything to without fear of judgement?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who's going to help you make those hard decisions like what color to paint a room or what kind of sandwich meat to buy?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don't know the answer to these questions. But if you have these same questions, know you are not alone. Out there is someone feeling the same thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Me, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> I definitely do not have it all together and some days I just wish I could pick up the phone to call Jayson "just because." But I can't.  I do however, surround myself with friends and family that make me feel safe. I've learned that transparency is not all bad. I've learned it's ok to have bad moments or days. It's ok for my girls to see me cry. It's even better for them to watch me pick myself up and go on with life. They are learning that there are things in this world that we can't control, but we don't have to allow them to control us. I am learning this as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So, for those reading this that feel alone and think that no one knows how it feels:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You are never alone. God is holding you and will guide you every step of the way. When you feel lost, take it one breath at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out. God's already done that. He knows your pain and He'll carry you through it if you allow him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> You may be angry with God and that's ok too. Yell, tell him how you feel. Throw things. Scream into pillows til your throat hurts (it won't take long and yes I know this from experience). Then, pick yourself up, THANK HIM for the time you were allowed to spend with HIS child before they were called home and then move forward. That looks different for us all. Don't expect it to be easy and don't go at it alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sign up for a Grief Group, journal, talk to your Pastor or a licensed counselor (Check my resources tab). Allow yourself to grieve, but don't allow yourself to go at it alone. It doesn't work and we were never meant to be alone anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.</strong> —<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31:8&amp;version=ESV">Deuteronomy 31:8</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What could anyone add to this promise? God is with us; He sees despair, and He promises to be with us throughout our seasons of grief.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope this little rant helps someone in some way and always feel free to share or comment if you have questions!</p>

		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p style="text-align: center;">Ever feel like your living someone else's life?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ever look around and wonder "Is this real?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That's everyday for me. Nothing is as it was. It's as if I'm living in a really screwy alternate universe where your worse fears come to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Losing J was my worse fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A dear friend of mine lost her husband 9 years ago. She and I have been friends since we were 13 and "odd." I immediately rushed to her parents house. I didn't know  if she wanted me there, but I showed up anyway. I didn't know what to say. I don't even remember what we talked about. I just remember laying in her parents bed with she and her sister. Thinking of that day makes me tear up. She was 22 and had a 3 month old.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She was the first person I called when J died. It was midnight and I just needed to talk to someone who knew my pain. All I could say was "How do I tell my girls?"  She didn't have an answer but gave me the best advice anyone has given me :</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"You are not crazy. No matter what you do or say or think, remember <strong>YOU ARE NOT CRAZY</strong>."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Seems silly that those words were the first thing she said to me, but I very quickly began to  understand what she meant.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I couldn't make decisions. I forgot to eat. I even forgot to go to the bathroom.  I had people "assigned" to me everyday. They had lists of things I was to accomplish that day. I had a schedule set by my friends, planning my every move. For the first week, I didn't stay at my own home. Leah and I were shuttled from home to home and looked after by extended family. A schedule was even made for my LuLu and who was in charge of her for the day. I wasn't in control of my own life and that was fine by me. I didn't feel competent to care for myself let alone my children.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> When I did go home almost a week and a half after J died, I had people stay with us overnight. It was an adjustment learning how to live without him. Feeding my children, getting them dressed and bathed, keeping their spirits up when mine were down were terribly difficult tasks. Slowly, I weaned myself off the help within about 2 months. The first night I was left alone with my girls, I had to call a friend to ask her what I was going to feed them for dinner. She walked me through what I had in my freezer and we settled on left over chicken and dumplins.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was simply lost without J.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Things are getting better though.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I still have trouble making simple decisions, but I can make them. I have days I forget to eat, but not as often. I sometimes hide in my room with the door locked and let my girls fight it out until they realize no one's gonna stop them. We eat out ALOT, but tonight I cooked breakfast for dinner and burned the bacon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I'm not perfect, but I'm trying.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I get up every morning and look my worst fear in the face. This is the new reality that I have to live. I'm attempting to make the best of a crappy situation and move forward. However, I'm not sure this feeling of a false reality will ever go away. I hope it does.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I do know a couple of truths though:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I have seen my worst fear and lived to share my experience,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am stronger than I ever thought possible and....</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>God is good <em>regardless</em> <em>and always.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We will move forward, overcome and be better because of this struggle.</p>

			<p><p>I dreamt about him last night.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen very often, but when it does I'm sad when i wake up. In my dreams I'm aware he's gone. But, he finds a way back, like it was all just a bad dream.</p>
<p>In my dreams, i can't let him go. We dance, we laugh, we talk about the girls, it's wonderful. Last night, we danced to End of the Road by Boyz to Men (90's kid). He spun me in circles, held me close, playfully dipped me backwards and pretended to drop me... all the things we always did.<br />
I miss dancing in the kitchen. I miss him grabbing me inappropriately in public and saying "what?" like he had no idea. I miss tripping over his boots he'd just leave in the middle of the floor. I miss his laugh. I miss the idea of him cleaning his shotgun the first time a boy shows up to take out our girls. I miss that our girls can't dance with their daddy anymore. I'm heartbroken that Lauren won't know what is like to attend the Princess Ball with her Daddy.</p>
<p>I miss the idea of what our life could've been.</p>
<p>But, that's the awesome thing about dreams. For a brief second in time, he's here. In my dreams, we are together again. In my dreams, I'm whole.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"Leah Katherine"</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"That is not the correct password. Try again."</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"Leeeahhh Kath-er-ine</em>"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Password doesn't match"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"LEEAAHH KATHEERINE"</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Ummm, that's not the correct password"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That's what I listened to for almost 20 minutes. LK got a password journal for Christmas and she's having a hard time getting it unlocked. See, to get into it, you must say the password EXACTLY the same way as when you set it. That's not easy for most adults, let alone a 6 year old. It can seem to be a near impossible task.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> That's how Christmas made me feel this year. It just didn't seem like an easy task to do everything as we've always done it. How can you continue doing something exactly the same as always when a huge part of you is gone?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You don't</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You change it up. Mix old traditions in with new. For us, that meant starting from scratch with decorations. I envisioned sitting in my living room floor, crying over boxes of ornaments from years past and never actually getting them put on the tree. Those boxes of decorations, once put out, would have become a shrine to Christmas past and the sentiment contained in them probably would have brought more sadness than joy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> That's not how I wanted my girls to remember their first Christmas without daddy. So, LK and I decided we needed a "Frozen" tree and went shopping. We purchased the brightest, whitest tree we saw and adorned it with everything we could find that sparkles. The smiles that followed were enough to convince me that the money spent was well worth it. (My friend, Stephanie, over at  <a href="http://theyammeringcabin.com/2014/12/14/12-days-of-everyday-beautiful-christmas-day-7-richardson-ranch/" target="_blank">The Yammering Cabin</a> graciously featured us in her Everyday Beautiful Christmas series.)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> We still went and looked at Christmas lights, still baked cookies for Santa and still opened presents on Christmas morning. Yeah, it sucked that Jayson wasn't there with us, but we can't put our life on hold. Our girl's deserve the childhood J and I wanted for them. No one asked for any of this and yes, it is a HUGE loss for my girls and I, but they need as normal of a life as I can give them now.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We did add one new tradition in though, a balloon send off.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The girls (LK) attached had written notes and a card to a dozen balloons and we sent them to heaven as a Christmas present for Daddy and a birthday present for Jesus. We watched them fly away and later in the day, when the sun came out, LK exclaimed that they must have reached heaven because that sun was shinning now.  I hope to continue this new tradition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/20141225_083817-e1420143487901.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-191" src="/max-repo/assets/20141225_083817-e1420143487901-169x300.jpg" alt="20141225_083817" width="169" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Christmas was good for us. There were no tears, no stress, minimal asking for daddy. My girls and I not only survived the holiday season, but we enjoyed it!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Life without my J isn't always easy. I miss him like crazy everyday. Today marks 4 months since he died and I'm not sad. Instead, I am happy that the girls are adjusting so well. I am impressed that we are all actually functioning and moving forward with life. I'm proud to say we have been making new memories without forgetting about the old.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Our life with J seems distant, yet still within reach. It's hard to actually believe he's not coming home, but it's so reassuring to know he left us surrounded by people who love us and encourage us. It's amazing the strength God has instilled in me to move forward and still  <em>REALLY LIVE</em> my life. My faith that <em>God's got this</em> is unfailing and doesn't waiver.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Maybe that's why Christmas wasn't hard. Maybe that's why I was able to kiss my babies at midnight on New Years without tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe, just maybe, God has more in store for my little family then we could ever imagine and this is only the beginning. I can't keep doing the same old thing. I can't make two holidays the same. It just isn't possible anymore. But, I can choose to accept that I can't replicate the past and choose to enjoy the here and now. I can choose to accept this gift of life God has given us and choose to treasure my memories.</p>

			<p><p style="text-align: center;">It's 2015! How'd you ring in the new year?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As for me and my girls, we spent it with great friends, lots of food, some play-dough and, of course, arm wrestling!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Are you jealous yet?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well, it gets even better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My girlfriends and I had an "Ugly face war" with friends in Ohio through Facebook. We were all winners (if you wanna call us that) and had a wonderful night!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope your 2015 brings much joy and laughter!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I will leave you with some pics from the evening (apologizing in advance if our craziness scares you) and will post again soon.</p>

		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p>My love affair with Brad Paisley began in my Senior year of high school. I was a hopeless romantic and would daydream about him singing to me and only me. There was just something about his voice. I've never swooned over a celebrity, but he's one that may just leave me speechless if we ever met.</p>
<dl id="foter-photo-figure" class="wp-caption foter-photo aligncenter" style="padding: 4px; border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #dddddd; width: 537px; color: #888888; overflow: hidden; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; position: relative; -ms-zoom: 1;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd" style="padding: 0; margin: 0;"></dd>
</dl>
<p>Jayson knew this when we met. He knew early in our relationship that I would leave him for Brad Paisley if ever the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>In college, Jayson worked for a security firm in Nashville. He was somewhat of a veteran there, so he was put in the best spots. Every year he worked backstage at the CMA's and he was never afraid to speak to any of the artists. Many of them remembered him from year to year and J was always impressed by that.</p>
<p>One particular year, very early in our relationship, he was backstage when he ran into..... Brad Paisley. A lesser man would've done something like pour dish detergent in his drink so bubbles would come out when he sang (Little Rascals reference). Not my J. With no jealousy or worry at all, he walked right up to Brad Paisley and said, <em>"Mr Paisley, my girlfriend just loves you. She swears she's gonna marry you one day."</em></p>
<p>Brad Paisley then said the words that forever changed my life:</p>
<p><em>"No. Tell her she's supposed to marry you."</em></p>
<p>So there it is folks. I owe Brad Paisley a big thank you for contributing to the best ten years of my life.</p>
<p>Jayson probably still would have asked me to marry him and I still probably would have said yes, however, it's always been a wonderful story to tell. I married my husband because Brad Paisley said so and it was the most wonderful advice ever given so, thank you Brad Paisley!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff99cc;"><em>*On a side note, I'm not a crazy stalker Mr Paisley. So, if you ever read this and wanna hook me up with tickets to a concert and maybe some meet and greet passes, I promise to be completely normal and chill. Also, our kids are about the same age and mine are available for play dates anytime!</em></span></h4>

<p>As I lay here attempting to sleep, these are the things running through my head:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>LuLu poured water in MY bed right where I lay! Great... </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Why won't my children sleep in their own beds? "Your feet do not belong on your sister's head!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Who ate a pop tart in my bed?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Stop picking your nose and wiping it on your sister!"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> I haven't washed my hair in a week! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Mom! Lauren just put a booger on me!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It is 10:00pm! Why are my children still awake?!?! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Lauren just bit me!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It's 32° outside. Why won't my dog come in? (Probably because she knows she'll sleep better outside where no one's flicking boogers on anyone. Seriously, am I raising monkeys?) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Why is she talking to herself? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I roll over to find my youngest "counting" her toes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> "I got this one and this one and that one and this one."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then it hits me as I stared into her sweet little eyes. They are all I have left of their daddy. These girls are him. I no longer get to fall asleep next to my best friend, but at least I have our babies. I may get flustered and sometimes hug them a little to tight to keep from pulling my own hair out, but I wouldn't have them any other way. I may think I want my bed back, but the truth is, it's comforting for all of us.  Who cares if they sleep with me until they leave for college? Right?... I believe we all need this bit of extra security right now and one day I'll wish for this back. So, for now I'll take the biting and boogers along with the giggles and snuggles. And, if I'm lucky, one day maybe I'll get some sleep again. Good night all!</p>

			<p><p>There was a day, not long ago, when my kids were angels. Everyone said please and thank you, they played together all day and never argued, no one broke anything, spilled their drink in my new car and they ate exactly what I gave them. That day, I went to the grocery store and ran all my errands with no meltdowns and no one looked at me like I was the worst mother in the store because there was no reason for it. We all got along, no one got their feelings hurt and everything went according to plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Haha! Are you kidding me? Sounds great though, huh?</p>
<p>I dream of the day I don't do something to damage my girls. I have an interesting sense of humor. The girls and I were out shopping with my SIL the other day at Kohl's and for some reason, my LuLu was mesmerized by every thing Pluto (Mickey's dog, not the once planet) she saw. It was really quite adorable. That same trip, LK carried a Lego book around and was enthralled with it. She loves to read. When we were checking out, I told her I wasn't buying it (little did she know, I did and it's under the tree). She told me I always say no to everything, so I said yes to the stuffed Pluto LuLu was loving on. LK didn't realize I let her have it until we got to the car.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"That's not fair!" She cried. "Why does LuLu get something and I don't?"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I said the first thing that popped into my head:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"It's because she's cuter than you". (I thought my SIL was gonna drop my youngest from shock)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>LK was semi in shock. I let that sink into her 6-year-old brain while I buckled her in.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Is LuLu really cuter than me?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Well look at her sweetie.</em><em>She's just downright adorable! But, you're my favorite," I whispered into her ear as a big ole cheesy grin appeared on her face.</em></p>
<p><em>"But, I'm still cute though, right?"</em></p>
<p><em>"You are, but I can only have one cute one and one favorite. I'm not allowed to make one both and even if I did, I couldn't tell you."</em></p>
<p><em>"It's me, they both yelled."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It was fun. Weeks later, I'm still using the cute one and favorite one as names for them. It annoys LK, but I figure whatever I'm doing to screw them up, therapy will fix, eventually.</p>
<p>So, for all of you competing for Momma of the Year, good luck with that. I'll be that mom in the grocery with the screaming kids, pinching one another and making a scene. Try not to be jealous of my awesomeness and remember, <strong>We all have mom fails EVERYDAY, but as long as you are raising them the way God has instructed </strong>(and they're still breathing)<strong> you are doing a great job! </strong></p>
<p><strong> Give yourself a pat on the back and some grace. </strong></p>

		</header>
		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p style="text-align:center;">Numb.:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Christmas is gonna be hard this year."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"I just need to make it through the holidays."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Numb.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Momma, I miss my Daddy."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Where's my Daddy?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"I just want my Daddy."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>NUMB, NUMB, NUMB, NUMB, NUMB!!!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Except today. Today has been tears and more tears. Today, there's no numbness, there's just lots of stress and sadness.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I have 2 sick children. They've both been puny for the past week. In the early hours of the morning they both woke up in tears. One had severe ear pain and the other just screamed for hours and couldn't tell me why. My first thought was to meltdown with them, but at 2am that accomplishes nada. So, after a brief battle with  <em>"I can't do this"</em> and<em> "I wish J were here"</em> I went numb. It's something I just channel somehow. It seems to be my coping mechanism.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Needless to say, none of us slept well at all. However, we all need consistency, so off to school, work and the sitter we went.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> An hour into my work day, I got <em>"the call."</em>  What makes this situation worse is that we STILL don't have insurance. I've been hounding the insurance call center since September with no luck. I can take my kids to the Dr, but out if pocket expenses can really add up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> I hit my breaking point.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I was done.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I said some less than pleasant things to the insurance call center rep on the other end of the line while he tried his darndest to talk over me. They tell you nothing and talk in circles. It's so frustrating! I wish I could numb myself to them... I think I will write my congressman.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Any who....</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Although it helps me function, this numbness isn't always good. People have been so kind and generous to my children and I.  I'm always sincere in my gratitude, but I'm numb.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Thank you for the card. It was beautiful" (polite smile).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Thank you for including us in your outing" (another polite smile).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"That gift was very thoughtful" (yet another polite smile)....</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Maybe you get the picture. I can't respond to things with the emotion I once had. I think it makes others believe I am ungrateful. As if I didn't care about their generosity .</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> This numbness keeps my guard up. I'm not the person I was 3 months ago. I can't remember to call. I don't always return texts. I don't have time for nonsense and hurt feelings. I really don't do small talk anymore and I'm more apt to keep to myself. It's not that I'm trying to be insensitive, I just really don't think anything of it. I have children that need me and they come first. Everyone and everything else is put on the back burner.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I'm numb.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I'm not numb because of the holidays. I'm numb because I lost part of me. I'm this way everyday. I know I'll <em>"get through"</em> Christmas because I've gotten through everyday for the past 3 months he's been gone. Christmas is just another day, just like Thanksgiving was. Sure, I love the meaning. Yes, I celebrate our Savior's  birth and I am passing the true meaning on to my girls, but I have yet to understand why such an emphasis is put on the holidays and getting through them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> I miss him <em>EVERYDAY.</em> I have to explain to a 2-year-old <em>EVERYDAY</em> that her Daddy's in Heaven. I have to muster up the strength to console my hurting 6-year-old <em>EVERYDAY</em>.  We make new memories without him <em>EVERYDAY</em>. I am trying to figure out who I am without Jayson<em> EVERYDAY</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">What's one day worth of memories when I have the loss staring me in the face <strong>EVERYDAY</strong>?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">AND.... I guess that's why I'm numb. Who could deal with all this from day-to-day while feeling EVERYTHING? It would drive you crazy. You'd need superpowers!  I cried when I heard an endearing story about someone helping a homeless man get back on his feet, but I didn't when someone unexpectedly left gifts on my porch for my children. That bothered me.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maybe I'm just numb to my own circumstance, or maybe God has just equipped me with what I need, when I need it so I can cope with mine and my children's new season of life with some sort of grace. I don't know. But, whatever it is, I know HE has given it to me and I will graciously accept it and glorify HIM through this storm and hopefully my family can be some kind of encouragement to others going through similar circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Thanks Y'all!</p>

		</header>
		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dog.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-97 size-medium" src="/max-repo/assets/dog-226x300.png" alt="" width="226" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I was getting take out at a Mexican place down the road when I noticed a cute little plush puppy with maracas and a sombrero. The five-year old in me came out and all I wanted to do was press the button that made him sing, or whatever it was that he did.</p>
<p>He was begging to be heard, but there were a ton of people standing around. If I pressed that button it's certain everyone would stare at this lone woman in the pink hoodie standing by the musical children's toy.</p>
<p>They'd probably all think I was nuts.</p>
<p>What would possess a grown woman to do such a thing?</p>
<p>All the while, little Cami (that's what I named it) was staring me in the face. Push my button! I wanna sing! I need to dance!</p>
<p>So, I did.</p>
<p>I set him free. Then, I grabbed my food and ran out the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got me to thinking about how easily we dismiss one another because of how it may inconvenience us or how others will view us.</p>
<p>Who cares what anyone else thinks? We run around, day-to-day collecting dots and stars (You should read You Are Special by Max Lucado if you're confused). We base our worth on the opinions of others when really, if we just devote ourselves to our maker, their stickers won't stick. The world can try all day long to convince you who you should be, but who's opinion means more?</p>
<p>I smile at people. I'm pleasant, most of the time. I don't do these things for gratitude or to impress, I do them because I know first hand that <strong><em>you never know what someone else is going through. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You may never know what a huge impact your smile and kind words can make. </em></strong></p>
<p>That woman who just yelled at you in your office may have just received some bad news and she doesn't know how else to react. She may just need someone to love her through her anger and she may just come back a few days later and thank you for your kindness, even though she didn't deserve it.</p>
<p>Everyone deserves to be noticed.</p>
<p>When my daughters say my name over and over and over again, they just want to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Humor that crazy woman in the grocery store who strikes up a conversation while looking at toothbrushes. It may just be the only adult interaction she's had all day (true story).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cami the maracan shaking dog was glad to be noticed, to be acknowledged and to be set free to share his joy. I'm glad I pushed the button. Everyone stopped and stared, but for a brief second before I darted, his cute little dance made me smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*<em>Thanks for humoring my silly little rant. Obviously, I don't get out much these days and it doesn't take much to get my brain going.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Hope you have a wonderful day.</span></strong></p>

<p>One night while I was at work, J called to tell me that he and a co-worker were going to get tattoos. I pleaded with him not to. I was convinced that a visible tattoo would ruin our lives. <em>Who would hire him? He'd never get a respectable job. We'd live in that tiny, 400 square foot apartment for life. How would we raise children there?</em> I'm pretty sure I hyperventilated and paramedics had to be called. Well, not really, but you would have thought he was robbing a bank, not getting a tattoo.</p>
<p>I spent more time on the phone that night than actually working. When he finally told me he couldn't go through with it I was relieved.</p>
<p><strong>White House here we come! Woo Hoo!</strong></p>
<p>He told me how he'd sat in the chair, they poked him once and he was done. He proclaimed it just hurt too bad and his co-worker mocked him for it. Then he stopped by my office. All the fears and worries of never being about to go out in public with him came running back when I saw the bandage around his left wrist.  With the simple word "<strong>FORGIVEN</strong>" he had single-handedly set us on the road to ruin.</p>
<p>I cried. Not just a little, but in that overly dramatic way that a woman who has just realized that all her hopes and dreams were just crushed cries. J felt horrible. Undoubtedly, I was supposed to laugh and call him a wimp for not going through with it. I guess he didn't know me that well back then. So, he did the best thing he could think of, he bought me a pretty bag. That was his "<em>I'm sorry I screwed up our life</em>" gift.  It was pretty and pink, so I told him we'd invest in a nice watch to cover it up.</p>
<p>Fast forward about 10 years. Jayson had been wanting to get to words "FOREVER" tattooed on his right wrist to compliment his forgiven tattoo. I would never agree to it. One was enough for me. But after his second brain tumor diagnoses, I came around. I shared with him how I would go with him and get, in his handwriting, "LOVE YOU MORE" on my left wrist. He ran through our friends home telling everyone. He was super excited. The more we discussed it, though, the more I realized how horrible his handwriting actually was. "LOVE YOU BORE" was one of the ways a friend interpreted how it would appear. Nevertheless, I made a promise and I was keeping it.</p>
<p>The day he died, I knew it was coming. That was the day I would have to give the ok to put him on life support and that's something he did not want. With all his crazy and spur of the moment things he did in his life, he was very clear on his final wishes. That Monday morning, I asked the doctors to delay taking him off the ventilator. I left the hospital to get a shower and change clothes. I didn't wanna smell funny my last few hours with him. I went to Target with my entourage and purchased sharpies. He had always wanted his friend to design a tattoo for him and I figured he could just free hand one on the fly.</p>
<p>I had been back at the hospital only a few minutes when the nurses asked me to come up. They told me, in private, that he was going on his own, cried with me and told me how sorry they were that I was losing my best friend. (His nurses became friends to me in just a few days.) I put on my best face, walked into his room and asked his parents to tell him good night. I was tired and wanted to rest. I asked one of our pastors who was there to pray him home, then everyone was gone. It was just me and my J. I called our girls and had them tell him good night. They knew he was in a coma, but didn't know what that meant. I showed him pictures and videos of our girls and although I was told he couldn't see or hear, he cried when our girls were singing Jesus Loves Me. I read him Bible verses a friend had printed out and put in a jar by his bed. I sang to him. I can't remember all the songs, but I know one was Even if the Healing Doesn't Come and another was Give Me Jesus.</p>
<p>Then I remembered his tattoo. I called my friend and asked her to bring me my bag. My friend Amy handed me a sharpie and my other friend Amanda helped me hold Jayson's ginormous hand while I wrote the word <strong>"FOREVER" </strong>on<strong> </strong>his right wrist. I then drew a little heart on his hand just because I knew it would annoy him. They helped me back into bed , put his arm around me and left. He took his last breath just moments later.</p>
<p>Our last hours together played out like a Lifetime movie. I had asked him to wait on me and he did. I asked him to allow me to be in his arms when he took his last breath, and he complied. He was awesome.</p>
<p>One month to the day, I fulfilled my end of the deal and got a tattoo. I have his final living heartbeat forever on my wrist. Everyday it still beats. Everyday it shows me he lived. His heart will forever be one with mine.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me share my heart.</p>

<p>Some of you may find this surprising, but I used to be a bit high-strung and somewhat snotty. So much, in fact, that 2 of my dearest friends, let's call them Brenda and Vanessa, did not like me. "Brenda" has been quoted saying that if you would have told her 10 years ago that she and I would be the best of friends, that she wouldn't have believed it. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have either. We were all in a small group together that my husband drug me to every week. Everyone loved him. They tolerated me. I was stuffy and tried to be prim and proper. They all liked to have fun and were way more outgoing than I was. That small group didn't last long after they cancelled one night and forgot to tell me. I stood on the front porch and watched our small group leader leave his house. He drove right past me and MY CAR sitting in front of his house and never stopped. Man, I really felt the love.</p>
<p>Somehow, J and I again ended up in a couples small group with the same 2 women and their husbands. (Different leader this time, THANK GOODNESS). They would plan outings and I would attempt to invite myself along. Somehow, eventually we all became friends and more people joined our group. We all sat together at church, had lunch at the same Chinese restaurant every Sunday, then were still excited to see one another and catch up Monday evening at group. It was as if we had a second family.Over the years, most of us have started families, some have moved churches and a couple of friends have moved away. But, one thing has always stayed constant, our unwavering love for one another.</p>
<p>When J was diagnosed with his 2nd tumor in June, we were devastated. These were the friends we turned to. They threw a party the weekend before his surgery just so we could be together for fellowship and prayer. He took part in the Ice Bucket challenge that night and danced a little penguin jig while we all laughed. When he was in surgery, they were there. Not everyone could be there physically, but the calls and texts proved that they wanted to be. When he took a turn for the worst, friends drove through the night to be by his side. When he died, they were there to hold my hand, offer encouragement and hold me at 2am when I completely lost it. You know you have a true friend when she instructs you how to breathe when you feel like you've forgotten.</p>

This was taken that afternoon before J passed away.[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so thankful that God made these people apart of my life. They have been there through the best and worst of days. Most people can't say they have 1 best friend. I have a community of believers by my side, encouraging me, helping me raise my children and loving us through the worst season we have yet to face. It is the best gift my husband could have ever given me and I'm glad I  broke out of my shell and accepted it.</p>

			<p><p>Monday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tiltedpicture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/done.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-115 size-full" src="/max-repo/assets/done.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To say I am displeased with this day is an understatement. Monday is that day I have to wake up before my children if I want a shower. Monday starts the week in which I will have to drag my oldest out of bed, physically dress her myself after threatening to send her to school in her jammies, frantically get out the door to get her to school on time (without breakfast) and maybe her teeth and hair were brushed. I don't know, but I know this truancy thing is serious business and some days I think my daughter wants me to spend some time in the slammer just so she can sleep in. That's Monday folks.</p>
<p>Every Monday morning I start my healthy eating campaign. <em>"No Chick Fil-a this week"</em>  I'll tell myself. <em>HA!</em> After dragging a child out of bed and making sure she at least looks like someone loves her, who has time for breakfast at home? My waist line hates me. But, the girl at the drive thru LOVES my glasses and knows my order. She could be my newest best friend.</p>
<p>Monday is also that day that people are gonna say things to me that make me want to poke them in the eye. For example, one Monday a few weeks ago, my girls were being particularly spirited while trying to get in the car after school. I had a moment and raised my voice (Southern woman don't yell. We raise our voice) as another mother was passing by with her perfect angels. <em>"I have a copy of (insert parenting unruly children book title here). Looks like you can use it!"</em> <strong>GRRRR</strong>. In my head I instructed that mother, very kindly, where she could put that book and that what I really needed was for my husband not to be dead. However, in real life, I just kept my back turned and continued buckling my children into their seats. Thank you kind woman for being so encouraging.</p>
<p>Mostly, I loathe Monday because it took my husband.</p>
<p>However, there are some truths about Monday that I have to share. Every Monday I am privileged to wake up with 2 precious loves snuggled up against me. Monday is the beginning of my work week and I adore my job and the women I get to do life with there. Monday was my last glorious day spent with my J. Monday was the day of our last kiss. It was the day of our last good morning and our final goodbye. Monday is a good day. Monday did not take my husband. Cancer and a worn out body did. Monday was the day I realized just how much <strong>God loves me</strong>. He showed me just how <strong>strong I really am</strong>. Monday is the day God revealed just how much <strong>the people in my life really care</strong>. Monday was the day I knew everything would be ok. Monday was the day I changed the way I see God. It changed our relationship. I'm not sure just how yet, but I'm sure it will be revealed in time.</p>
<p>Oh, and someone paid for my meal at Chick Fil-a this morning. Monday, you are redeemed.</p>
<p>Happy Monday!</p>

<p>I had a <em>touch</em> of OCD when my husband and I first started dating in college. We rented our first apartment and eventually, we got married. He was bound and determined to break me of my compulsion for perfection in those early years. He would come in and shed his shoes, socks and shirt as he walked, leaving a trail of clothing through our tiny apartment. He would deposit the contents of his pockets onto our entertainment center, then sit and relax. <em>HE WOULD SIT AND RELAX. RELAX! </em>I, on the other hand, would see the clutteration (not a word. I know and I don't care.) of our 400 square foot apartment and lay in the floor and cry (I was also a bit dramatic). He would tell me to get over it and he would go along with his relaxing. This went on forever. He said that one day, when we had children, he would teach them to tilt all the pictures in our home just enough to drive me insane.</p>
<p>He never got the chance. Our girls are 6 and 2 and he left this Earth 3 months ago to spend eternity with the Lord. His infatuation with trying to cure my perfection complex never stopped and now carries on with our children.</p>

<p>Jayson had an infectious laugh. People around him couldn't help but be caught up in his joy. He loved life, God, his friends and especially his family. His girls were his world. He was a father, a husband, a friend, a son, a brother, an uncle, a youth leader, a mentor, a jokester, a technical support guru, a lover of history and guns and always willing to help someone in need. He once gave a teen at church the shirt he was wearing because the kid said he liked it. There was another kid who changed the spelling of his name to match Jayson's because J told the kid it was the "right" way. He influenced those around him. He was amazing.</p>
</div>
<p>He died on a Monday in September from surgical complications. He had been diagnosed with a brain tumor in June. It was the 2nd in 4 years. The first surgery was successful. There was really no reason to believe this one would be any different. He came out of surgery in great spirits. He was smiling and goofy. He was amazed that his nurse had hazel eyes, just like him. The recovery seemed to be miraculous compared to the first time. Our oldest, LK, was even able to visit him in the hospital. But that was the night everything went downhill. He slowly stopped talking and was staring off into space. He became violently sick late that night and the next day we discovered that, not only did he have a very aggressive form of brain cancer, but he also had bleeding on the brain. He was moved back to the ICU that afternoon and had a massive seizure that he never woke up from. He died 3 days later with me in his arms.</p>
<p>It all played out like a movie. People came from all over to lay hands on him and pray. I begged and pleaded in the hospital chapel in the wee hours of the morning, just knowing that God was going to heal my husband.<em> We were good people. Bad things happened to us, but they always turned out fine in the end. I asked, so I knew I would receive. I believed, so I could move mountains. I kept the faith and stayed strong.</em> <strong>I put God in a box. I held Him accountable to my standards. I acted as if He owed me. As if He served ME!</strong> Funny, huh? <strong>I was trying to make God conform to my idea of perfection, when He is perfect. God works miracles, He heals, but not always in the way we expect</strong>. God healed my husband. He gave him a new, healthy body. Our girls did not have to watch him suffer. They did not watch their daddy deteriorate. They remember him loving and strong, funny and kind. They remember him, not his sickness. I believe that is the true blessing in all of this sadness. I believe that our new life is all part of God's perfect plan.</p>

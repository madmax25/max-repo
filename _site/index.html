			<p><blockquote>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Do you ever think you'll get remarried?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Are you dating?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Are you gonna date?"</em></p>
<p>It seems like from the second I became a widow people started asking those questions.</p>
<p>Honestly, Â I found them completely rude and inconsiderate for a very long time. That is not a subject to bring up to someone who has just lost their best friend. However, Â it has been 2 and a half years, Â so here's some thoughts on the matter:</p>
<p>It's my life. Â I'll share what I see fit when I want to share it. Â That's not meant to be ugly in the least, Â it's just exhausting to field those questions from my children let alone every well meaning person who knows our situation.</p>
<p>Yep, my girls even ask.</p>
<p>All the time actually.</p>
<p>They wanna know if God is gonna bring them another daddy. Not one to replace their daddy in heaven, but one who can be a physical daddy here. One that they can see and hear and hug. One that will not die while they are little. A daddy like other kids have. It's not fair that other kids have daddy's and their's is in heaven.</p>
<p>Those are all their words, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>It breaks my heart.Â </strong></p>
<p>They had something so <strong><em>extraordinary</em></strong> that they long to have it again. I know that we had someone so wonderful that no one could ever fill his shoes.</p>
<p>So, Â here's my honest to God thoughts on dating and marriage to all you who are on the edge of your seats, Â biting your nails and awaiting some great wisdom.</p>
<p>In cases such as mine, I don't believe in soul mates. I believe God sends us people who will make us better just for knowing them. I believe that not everyone is meant to be in your life forever. Â I believe that God has got my life in his hands and if there is someone out there for me and my girls that he'll show up in our lives when he shows up. I'm in no rush and I'm certainly not looking.</p>
<p>Besides, I'm at the gym 3 days a week (I'm actually on a treadmill as I'm composing this), school/work 2 days, dance class 2, gymnastics 2, soccer 3 and at church related functions at least 3 days every week. That's way more than 7 days a week. Mr "Future Dad/Husband" better show up at one of those places if he wants to catch me. ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>So, Â if you know someone who's lost their spouse or divorced, don't ask them when they think they'll be ready to date again. Â I promise you, Â it's probably the last thing on their mind. If it's in the cards for them, Â it'll happen when it happens and when they are face to face with the right person.</p>

			<p><p>My world is very loud these days.</p>
<p>Whether it's from a television, a radio, children.... There's always noise. Â There's laughter, crying, lots of whining, but not much silence.</p>
<p>Even in the silence, Â my brain can't shut off. <em>"What should we do? Will LuLu get through a whole day without a meltdown? Will the playroom EVER be clean?"</em></p>
<p>Then there's the questions and thoughts about my life. <em>Â "Am I living the life God wants for me? Tomorrow I will eat healthier. I will lose the weight I've gained, but do I really care? Â Will I continue to be lonely? Â I'm happy, but could I be happier? Â Do I really want to bring someone into our lives? Â God, just point me in a direction please. I just don't even know where to begin."</em></p>
<p>Even silence is deafening.</p>
<p>My ears will start ringing as the thoughts just keep flowing. Â It helps to write them down, Â but they spew out faster than I can think to grab a pen. Then, once I do, they're gone and I can't remember what I wanted to write.</p>
<p>I believe I have a best seller in my head, Â but it just gets jumbled up with everyday noise.</p>
<p>The times I do slow my thoughts down enough to pen them, Â I don't want to share. I know I have a God given talent when it comes to writing and I want to help others struggling with similar circumstances. Â However, Â sharing my thoughts makes me more vulnerable to my already close knit community.</p>
<p>Just because I write about it today, Â doesn't mean I want to talk about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>It just means that now, at this precise second, Â these thoughts need to be released and once they are<em><strong> I'm free</strong></em>. Â Free from the noise they are making in my brain. Â It's just one more traffic jam in my head that's clearing up. Â The ringing slows and, Â for a minute, Â there's silence.</p>
<p>Until the next thought, that is.</p>

<p>This is Moriah Peters.</p>
<p>She is probably, Â without a doubt, Â my daughters favorite singer.Â Â Last night, Â she FINALLY got to meet her. We've attempted to talk to her the last 3 times we were in the same building and it's for more than just a photo op.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Â in the summer of 2014 I called into a radio show, Â gave the phone to LK, and she won a contest. Â Her prize? Â Moriah Peters' CD, <em>Brave</em>. That summer, Â we listened to the title track on repeat. Â Over and over and over and over, Â all I heard was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You make me Brave, Â wanna be stronger BRAVE, wanna be bolder BRAVE....</em></p>
<p>That was our summer anthem. I have videos of my then 6 and 2 year olds belting out these words. It wasÂ sweet.</p>
<p>Then, Â something horrible happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Â On September 1, 2014, my husband, my daughters' daddy, our best friend, went to live with Jesus.</p>
<p>It's funny how you canÂ listen toÂ a song 5 million times, and never actually HEAR it until you need it. Â See, the opening line of the song says<em> "No oneÂ told meÂ this would be easy, Â but I never knew that it would be this hard. Â Oh the worry is weighing on me. Â Would you help me break down all these question marks and make me Brave."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Crazy huh?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Never heard<em> those </em>lyrics before<em>. </em></p>
<p>Â I bawled. Then I got it. Â God had been preparing us. He used this song that<em>Â (if I'm being honest)</em> was beginning to annoy the snot out of me, to teach me that I wasn't alone. When I actually listened to the lyrics, Â I heard that God knew how hard this was gonna be for me and for my children,Â but thatÂ <strong>HeÂ </strong>would equipÂ us with whatÂ we needed to move forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Funny how a song from a person I only knew from her album cover could convey so much!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I let Leah help with the playlist at her Daddy's celebration of life and, along with For KingÂ &amp; Country's <em>Fix My Eyes</em> and Moriah's version of <em>Give Me Jesus</em>, <em>Brave</em> was at the top of her list. It played in rotation during the pre-service encouraging me and reminding me that we'd be ok.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My daughter may not quite get it now, Â but one day she'll understand the impact this song and artist had on her summer and healing. AND last night, IÂ was ableÂ to (very briefly) share a tidbit of how God used her in our story with the artist who spoke God's promise to my family through her song!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How cool is that?!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wanna know something even more awesome?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>God's timing</strong>, that's what!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Â This week marks 2 years since we lost Jay.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Coincidence? I think not?</p>

			<p><p>Ever have one of those days when you're perfectly fine? You get up, get the kids to school, have a perfectly normal day at work, then <em><strong>BAM</strong></em>!, out of nowhere you have an anxiety attack driving back to the office after lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>That happens to everyone, right?</em></p>
<p>You get the urge to scream, but you can't and you don't know why. You've been fine. Sure, life isn't all you've ever dreamed, but you're managing. Or, are you? <em>BOOM</em>! In sneaks all your insecurities, all your fears, all the conversations you've had with your children where you were perfectly level headed, until that drive back to the office. Now you're all alone and your thoughts can get the best of you.</p>
<p>The night before, your 7 year old tells you someone told her that one day, Jesus would come back and bring her Daddy back with him. She is very confused by this. You try to clarify, but all your 3 year old hears is that Jesus is bringing daddy home. She proceeds to jump up and down on the bed exclaiming how she can't wait and how she hopes it's tomorrow. No amount of explaining can convince her that her Daddy won't be coming home tomorrow.</p>
<p>You cry yourself to sleep.</p>
<p>Your alarm goes off. You don't know what day it is. You struggle to get out of bed 45 minutes later, yet still have a great morning with your children and everyone gets to where they need to be in great spirits.</p>
<p>You interact with people all morning. Work is hectic, your office is a bit disheveled from being so busy, but your fine despite the crazy. In fact, the crazy is keeping you sane! The less you can think about home, your kids, yourself the better. But, that didn't last forever.</p>
<p>Images of that precious baby, bouncing on your bed in excitement creep in when you're alone. And that, my friends, is what causes you to cry so hard in your car that an hour later your eyes still burn.</p>
<p>Just a typical day in the life of the grieving. They're not all like this, but they want to be. See, it's never ending. You hear a girl yell out Daddy and turn to see an embrace that your children don't get. It's unfair. Death is unfair. Being a single mom is unfair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Life is unfair.</strong></em></p>
<p>Listening to other people complain about petty things makes you wanna explode. Stop complaining and do something!</p>
<p>You just don't get it unless you've been there. Don't tell someone who's grieving to "<em>get over it</em>" or "<em>time heals</em>" because it doesn't work that way. You never get over it, you learn to live with the pain and the healing part, well that depends on the day. When you lose a part of you, it causes you to rethink everything about yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Who are you? What do you do now?</em></p>
<p>The answers to those questions depend solely on you. As much as you want someone else to take the wheel, you are ultimately in control of your actions. <strong>No one can, nor should they, tell you how you should be.</strong></p>
<p>As for me? Most days I'm fine. I get by. But, I never know when that MACK truck of emotion is going slam into me and make me a basket case. I hate it, but I've come to terms with it. Life is what it is. You just have to take it minute by minute and know that, one day, that "<em><strong>BAM</strong></em>" moment might just be a good surprise.</p>
<p>Kelly</p>

			<p><p>11 months today (not today, today. August 1st), around 10pm, my Jayson took his last breath. The support that followed from family, friendsÂ and even complete strangers was something I never could've dreamt of. From cleaning my house and taking care of my children to making sure we were fed, our community took care of our every need.</p>
<p>Then, the mailbox started to fill up with letters and cards. Flowers filled my home. They were kind gestures, but I resented them. Most of the plants, I gave away. The cards were thrown in a box, never again to see the light of day, or so I thought.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with a friend, she asked if I had read the cards yet. <strong><em>Of course not</em></strong>! I hadn't given them a second thought since the majority of them were thrown across my home in fits of anger, then eventually, placed in a box for safe keeping because I did appreciate that people cared enough to send one.</p>
<p>Her question peeked my curiosity.</p>
<p>I couldn't remember who attended his memorial service, let alone those who sent cards and flowers. I can't even remember if I sent thank you cards or even acknowledged receiving anything! That was a dark time and I assume (<em>really, I'm hoping)</em> no one was offended by my lack of gratitude at that time.</p>
<p>I climbed into the top of Jayson's freshly packed up closet and dug out the picture box that held everything that was given to me. There were beautiful poems, bible verses written on slips of paper, cards from the flowers, (<em>that I had no idea I had saved)</em> and an endless sea of envelopes. Way too many to open and read in one sitting. So, I reached in and grabbed just one.</p>
<p>It was from my mom.</p>
<p>I remember looking at it when it was handed to me originally. I did read it, but didn't see the words. I didn't "<em>see</em>" anything at that time. Reading this card reminded me of how much I've missed this past year. I was present, but I was indifferent. Nothing had <em>really</em> made me happy. I hadn't experienced <em>real</em> joy.</p>
<p>Then, at some point a few months ago,Â something clicked. A fog was lifted and life began again. No more auto pilot. No more "<em>what am I doing</em>." My eyes were opened and I was finally adapting to my "new normal" (I hate that phrase by the way...)</p>
<p>This past weekend, Jayson would have been 33.</p>
<p>I could've just ignored it like I did Father's Day, but that just didn't seem right. This was the dayÂ my best friend, my husband,Â Leah and Lauren's daddy, was born!Â It truly was a day to celebrate, so we did.Â I wanted to invite everyone who had been here for us this past year, but my street couldn't hold that many cars. The girls and I rented a water slide, my sister in law filled a pool with water balloons,Â my girls baked and decorated a cake (on their own),Â Jayson's mom and sister drove in from New Mexico. We ate good food, laughed and reminisced. The kids were non-stop. It was wonderful!</p>
<p>At the end of the party, we released balloons. During the party, guests wrote messages to J on them. Some were super heartfelt, some were silly inside jokes. We sang Happy Birthday, then sent our birthday greetings to heaven.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-8" style="color: #222222; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7; height: auto; max-width: 98%; border-color: #eeeeee; display: block; margin-top: 5px !important; margin-right: auto !important; margin-left: auto !important;" src="/max-repo/assets/439.jpg?w=300" alt="Some crazy college kids..." width="300" height="192" /><br>
Some crazy college kids...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Â Jayson and I met when we were 19. We were best friends from the second we spoke. He had to move home for a semester for a shoulder surgery (<em style="font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">he totally separated his shoulder playing FLAG football!!</em>) and I drove 50 miles each way just to hang out with him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He, however, persued me. I wasn't looking for a boyfriend, nor did I want one. But, Jayson was the kind of person who wouldn't take no for an answer. Eventually, he always got what he wanted. And, although I knew from the moment we met that I would marry him someday, he still had to convince me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's always been hard to get my head and my heart to agree. I'm stubborn. I don't always believe what my heart is trying to tell me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, fast forward 14 years and that fun loving, spirited, stubborn girl is now wiser, a single mom of 2, still fun loving and spirited, but a little broken.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-118" style="color: #222222; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7; height: auto; max-width: 100%; border: 1px solid #dddddd; padding: 6px; margin-top: 0.4em;" src="/max-repo/assets/20150516_091804.jpg?w=300" alt="20150516_091804" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Where do I go from here?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, let me fill you in on a highly guarded secret : I am clueless.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shortly after Jay's death, I feel the Lord opened my eyes and heart to the promise of new possibilities. Although, my head saidÂ <em style="font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">"You are crazy. Do you actually believe YOU can find THAT again? You had it, it's gone, deal with the fact you will be alone forever! No one wants your baggage!"</em>Â I don't feel those are Gods words though. Those are words of fear, words coming from not knowing what's in store and maybe being fearful of the future. It's way easier to shut everyone out and completely live inside yourself then it is to open yourself up to new possibilities, new beginnings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a while I felt extremely guilty. Why was I even allowing myself to think of ever dating again or eventually maybe even falling in love?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I started dreaming of Jay. The dreams were so real that when I woke up, I couldn't see reality. Waking up alone, raising two girls by myself, dealing with everyday issues without him, that was the dream.Â Those dreams of him by my side made it really hard to cope and even function for that matter. I felt crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I finally got up the nerve to tell one of my girlfriend's and we both prayed for the dreams to stop. Funny, huh. All I've wanted was to have him back, go back in time, but now I'm asking God to take him away.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, the dreams stopped and with them came a sense of relief, but the guilt came sneaking back in. Satan likes to hold things against you. He wants you to be miserable, not God. Guilt for no reason, is not from the Healer, but from the enemy. So, I fought it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm a fighter, so it seems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like I said, I'm still trying to figure out if I really believe what I say that comes from my heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, 2 days ago I dreamt of him again. This dream I knew was a dream, though it was so very real. I went to bed with thoughts of "what ifs" dancing around my brain. "What if I found someone? What would that look like? What would people say? Do I care what people would say? What about my girls? How would that work?" You get the point.... When I finally fell asleep, Jayson was there. He told me I had to let him go. I cried and said no, but he insisted. He said that God was waiting on him and he really wanted to go, so I had to let him. Then, we were at our sitters house (she promised J she'd take care of "his girl's," all of us). He just stood over her for a second, I don't know if he spoke and I couldn't figure out if she even knew he was there, then he climbed a ladder and disappeared.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I woke up with the most peace I've had in a while. I don't know if that was God or J or my subconscious, who knows, but I'd like to think it was God allowing J to reassure me that we will be fine, that I am OK.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I smiled all day. I was giddy with the thoughts of new possibilities, of opening myself up again. I'm not saying I'm looking by any means, but if God presents someone to me, my eyes are open. I can't get my head to agree with that, but my heart says, "why not?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'm working on believing what I say. I'm working on listening to my heart. It's been 9 months and I'm still standing, so I guess I'm doing something right. Starting from scratch is scary. It's unpredictable and I'm terrified. However, the possibilities are endless. It's a beginning of a new story and I can't wait to see how it plays out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kelly</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">Our stories make us stronger... All aboard brave souls. We move on, but we never, ever forget.</em></p>

<p>It's here.</p>
<p>FATHER'S DAY.</p>
<p>The day my children are reminded <em>ALL DAY LONG</em> that their daddy is not with them.</p>
<p>This past week has been a very difficult week. We've had meltdowns, angry outbursts, crying forÂ daddy in the middle of the night, and lots of sadness. I did NOT want today to be a continuation of this emotional week. <strong>Jayson was an AMAZING daddy</strong>. His girls adored him with every ounce of their being. He was silly. He loved to pick at them. There has always been way more laughter in our home than there has been tears. I wanted to honor that, not sit around and mope.</p>
<p>So, I made plans. The girls and I were going to spend the day at a water park with family. But, that fell through, so I woke up this morning trying to decide what to do. It didn't have to be something grand, but it had to be fun. I decided to call my mom and take the girls to the new American Girl Store. It was the one place I knew we wouldn't run into lots of daddy's on Father's Day. We skipped church (<em>because, let's face it, making a craft for your father when he's in Heaven is not really all thatÂ awesome)</em> andÂ headed off. I made a big deal about getting to look at everything in the store and eating cupcakes with our dolls, Kit and Wild Style (<em>Can you guess who owns Wild Style?).</em> I even told Leah they might be able to get the twin dolls, but we'd have to see.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? You can't get a reservation at a Bistro on the same day. Even if it is Father's Day. I guess other single mom's had the same idea.</p>
<p>I was bummed, but, we were gonna make the best of it. So, we hadÂ a lunch of pizza and Japanese in the food court <em>(2 of J's favorites</em>) then started our adventure into American Girl with two 3 year olds, a 7 and 13 year old and 3 adults.</p>
<p>Having never stepped foot in that place, I was in awe! So girlie and fun! They had everything! I'm so glad I had other's with me to help keep an eye on my kids because I was enjoying looking at the dolls and their accessories. I really wanted to get the Girl of the Year, Grace, (<em>for the girl's, of course</em>) but can't just buy one doll for 2 girls.... sadness. Anyway, LuLu tried on dresses in the "Princess Dressing Room" and had to touch everything she saw. Leah wanted it all too and kept trying to talk me into carry bags for her doll and puppies because they need pets! I spent almost as much as I spend on myself for Kit and Wild Style at the Spa. Wild Style really needed it though, her hair was horrific! Kit was pretty with her new braid that Leah meticulously chose. LuLu squealed with excitement as the stylest finished tying ribbons in Wild Style's hair.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-353" src="/max-repo/assets/collage_20150622074933309_20150622074943736-300x300.jpg" alt="collage_20150622074933309_20150622074943736" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>We hung around the store for what seemed like hours before Leah reminded me I said we could look at the twin dolls. I called Lauren over and they each got to pick their own. Those dolls, although still not cheap, are half the price of the others so I was reasoning with myself in my head that it wasÂ ok. I'm pretty frugal. The dolls my girl's have were bought by other people. But, I figured it was ok because this was a special day of sorts.</p>
<p>While reasoning it out in my head and trying to convince myself it was ok, I did something I rarely do in public. I told the sales lady helping us that today was our first Father's Day without daddy, that we lost him in September and that I was just trying to make it a good day for my babies.Â I don't tell people about my life in random, everyday conversations. I don't want people to feel sorry for us. But, for some reason, I told this random woman at the American Girl store while my girls were picking out their new dolls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Well, the most extraordinary thing happened</strong></em>.</p>
<p>She went to the back as we anxiously awaited our newest babies and came back with not only the babies, but reservations for the Bistro as well! She said that my story touched her so much that she wanted to do something for us, so they arranged for my family to have desserts on <em>THEM</em>! How amazing is that?!? I totally hugged her. I had woken up with the idea of cupcakes with their dolls on Father's Day and this kind lady made it happen!</p>
<p>LuLu was so overjoyed aboutÂ her pink cupcake and sprinkles that she shared them with her new baby "Pi" (<em>I'm calling her Penelope</em>). Lulu and Pi were both <em>COVERED</em> in pink icing by the time she was through. Wild Style enjoyed some vanilla ice cream. Both dolls were lucky enough to have LuLu lick their faces of the sugary treats while Leah carefully decorated both her cupcakes with perfection before she ate them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-354" src="/max-repo/assets/collage_20150622074559823_20150622074612218-300x235.jpg" alt="collage_20150622074559823_20150622074612218" width="300" height="235" /></p>
<p>It was a wonderful day. I'm so thankful for the kindness that was shown to my family today from everyone we encountered. It was a day filled with laughter, excitement and lots of pink cupcakes. If Jayson can't be here to celebrate with us, I think our adventure today was a great plan B. Father's Day without Daddy wasn't near as sad as I thought it would be. Maybe pink cupcakes at the American Girl Bistro will be our new tradition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Happy Father's Day to all you Dad's out there and also to all you Momma's who are pulling double duty. Try to keep it fun!</em></p>

			<p><p><em>*I wrote this a few weeks back. Just waited a while to post it.*</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Today I did something big.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>People congratulated me and seemed more excited at my accomplishment than I was.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>It was very strange.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>I made 2 ladies cry as I explained how I came to this point. As normal, I kept a straight face and told them it's OK, that the girls and I have adjusted to life without any major complications. That this was all part of God's plan and that we are moving forward.</p>
<p>As I walked out of the bank, I held back my tears. This was a huge deal, but it was so bittersweet not to have Jayson there smiling back at me and say "<em>we finally did it. <strong>We are debt free.</strong>"</em></p>
<p>So, I celebrated,<em> alone</em>.</p>
<p>My shindig included a takeout lunch of a chicken baked potato and a sweet tea. I was gonna splurge on some banana pudding, but they were out. Then my day of putting away mounds of laundry scattered throughout my house was put on the back burner so I could catch up on Once Upon A Time, take a nap and eat way too many Hersey's Nuggets with almonds. That was followed by a rush across town to pick up my girls because I overslept.</p>
<p>I guess you can call that a celebration of sorts, or maybe that's just how I cope.</p>
<p>See, that was the last thing on my list. Jay and I were very prepared for the unthinkable. We discussed, in detail, what we'd do if one of us unexpectedly passed away. We knew who we'd name as beneficiaries, take over raising our kids, had enough life insurance to pay all our debt and then live a comfortably modest life. I told him that I'd want him to find love and be happy. He told me he wanted me to be sad and miserable forever<em>.Â </em>I laughed. He said he wasn't kiddingÂ <em>(he had a great sense of humor)</em>.</p>
<p>I have officially fulfilled my end of the deal. All of it. And, although I miss him dearly, I know he'll always have a huge chunk of me that he took with him. I'm not saying I'm healed, far from it really, but I see now that God has plans for my girls and I that I would have never foreseen. Who knows, as a sweet friend recently said to me, <em>"our husband's could be in heaven looking down and playing match maker."</em> It's a funny thought that makes me giggle every time it crosses my mind.</p>
<p>Now, all I have to do is raise my girls the best I can, try to find some time to figure out who I am now and hope I can clearly hear God's instructions on where to go from here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Easy peasy, right?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><p>Picture this:</p>
<p>You are traveling for the first time by yourself on a plane with two children, 7 and 3. Not only are you worried about them having meltdowns, but you yourself are scared of flying (well, take off and landing).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
First flight is a dream. Smiles, laughter, looks of approval from other passengers. It was glorious!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, your well planned hour and a half layover is in a tiny airport with wall to wall people and no where for the children to run off energy. Not only that, but the little one (<em>who hates to poop and waits until the very last second to tell you she has to go</em>) starts screaming and crossing her ankles. <em>So</em>, off you run to the only bathroom, which by the way, only has 2 stalls and there's 10 people in front of you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What then?</p>
<p>Well, the small child poops her panties and you have the 7 year old hold up a blanket to cover said child while you clean her off and put on a pull up in the middle of the terminal. You clean your hands the best you can with a wipe and try to cover the smell with lotion. The smell doesn't come off your hands though.</p>
<p>Now you are boarding the plane and the 7 year old exclaims she has to pee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Of course she has to pee now! Why wouldn't she have to pee <strong>NOW</strong>?</em></p>
<p>But, you don't have time to run back and wait in line, so you tell her to wait till you get on the plane. However, the plane is packed and she can't get back to the bathroom, so she has to wait until you get in the air.</p>
<p>Can you say <em>turbulence</em>?</p>
<p>Yep, that's right. You are now sitting next to a crying child who can't move because if she does, she'll wet herself. Then the panic sets in her eyes and you are no longer afraid of the wrath of the flight attendant, you run your child to the bathroom only to find the flight attendant sitting by the door and telling you that you're supposed to be seated.</p>
<p>Then, it happens.</p>
<p>You start balling like a baby. Big, ugly sobs. You apologize and try to make an audible apology, but all that comes out is something about <em>just trying to hold it together on your first trip without your husband because he died and she was about to wet herself....</em>HeÂ gets up and grabs tissues, you send your child to the potty and here comes your other child running down the aisle.</p>
<p>You cry some more.</p>
<p>You all return to your seats, with the box of tissues because the flight attendant insisted, and you continue to cry.</p>
<p>Your bag is now filled with tissues and the youngest starts screaming she has to poop. <strong>Dear God, let's not repeat this,</strong> you think to yourself. Then you smell the poo and the child knocks her water into the floor soaking the bag under her seat which belongs to someone else. You choose not to tell the bags owner and hope he doesn't notice until you are long gone.</p>
<p>The flight attendant offers you different varieties of adult beverages multiple times. Then your youngest starts screaming like someone's trying to kill her. Flight attendant comes back by to offer you some wine.</p>
<p>You get off the plane with a smelly, sleepy child, frazzled nerves, dirty princess undies in your bag and pretty sure your hand still smells like poo.</p>
<p>You cry again because you are so glad to be off that God forsaken Hell plane. Then you cry some more because you see your late husband's mother and sister on the other side of the terminal.</p>
<p>Everything is much better after that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Laugh if you must, but I totally lived this today on a flight from Kansas City to Albuquerque. Your day doesn't seem so bad now, huh? Good! Glad I can help!</em></p>

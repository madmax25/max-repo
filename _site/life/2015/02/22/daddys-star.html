  Daddy's Star

<p>Edit<em>:  The past couple of weeks have been difficult for me.  I've been in pain,  had an unexpected surgery, and just not in the best place emotionally.  Then,  one night I looked up and "Daddy's Star" was shinning brighter than it every has.  Of course I bawled,  but then I smiled.  He's always with us if we just look.  Hope you enjoy reading this, again, because I sure did.  </em>❤❤</p>
<p>The previous owners of our home had an obsession with glow in the dark stars.  They were on the ceiling of every room in the house.</p>
<p>These <em>oh so delightful</em> people left these wonderful decorations when we bought the house from them. They dug up bushes, took down blinds, but left their precious glow in the dark stars <em>(along with about $500 worth of tires in the attic that we happily put on Craigslist.)</em></p>
<p>Anyway, I was 7 months pregnant with Leah when we closed and a dear friend took my over dramatic representation of the state of the house to be fact and sent a cleaning party of around 20 people to my house one cold, January morning.</p>
<p>One particular task that was given to our new Pastor was to walk around and take all the stars down. He served this mundane task with pride and a smile. <em>(There's a pretty good chance he may hate these things after this task.)</em></p>
<p>A week or so later, Jayson and I were settled in our new home. It didn't take long to realize that one star still remained right above our bed, on Jayson's side.</p>
<p>In true Jayson form, he made jokes about it. It was a fun little reminder of having a servants heart and also of the fact that our Pastor was asked to take stars off our ceiling.</p>
<p>When Leah was old enough to notice it, she named it <strong><em>"Daddy's Star."</em> </strong>Anytime she crawled into bed with us she pointed it out. It was special to her. Then Lauren came along and it was a fun game to find <em>"Daddy's Star."</em> We'd climb into our bed and gaze at the ceiling. It's a small star, so your eyes have to adjust just right to see it. The first child to find it would point up and exclaim "<strong><em>There it is! I found daddy's star!"</em></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes J and I would point it out to one another without the girls help. He was fascinated with stars and constellations anyway, so having his own star indoors became an honor. <em>☺(He was a nerd.)</em></p>
<p>Now, it's just me and my girls. They still crawl in my bed and they still make a game out of pointing out daddy's star. That once little annoying decoration has become a wonderful memory. To find <em>"Daddy's star"</em> is now not only an accomplishment, but they find comfort in it. It's simply beautiful how something so silly and ordinary can hold such a strong place in our hearts.</p>
<p>That star being left there was an oversight by our Pastor, but God had a purpose in leaving it there. Every other star is gone but that one has stood strong.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Jay went home to be with the Lord 5 1/2 months ago, but his legacy lives on. We are so blessed by the memories that even the most mundane of things carry. He left us a good life. He left us with family and friends whom he groomed for years to take care of us. He left us knowing we'd be given the strength that only God can give to get us through the darkest moments. His love shines down on us through the stars and back.</p>
<p>His loss has been devastating. But, we know we were meant to be God's shining light. We will burn bright for all to see and smile right back at the star shining down on us.</p>
<p>Hope you all are having a wonderful week!</p>

			<p><p>As kids, most of us dreamed about what we wanted to be when we grew up. I wanted to be a fashion model, walking the runways in Paris wearing designer clothes and just being fabulous.</p>
<p>That dream was short lived.</p>
<p>I'm five foot nothing and I like food.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to be on Broadway. I even applied at schools in New York before I realized that I was too practical to chase after something that would never be a sure thing. (I would not be a graceful "starving artist" type.)</p>
<p>So, I went the "practical" route. I enrolled at a school near home and declared my major as Public Relations. I wanted to travel, see the world and meet interesting people. That seemed like the way to do it.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I met J and that all changed. My goals and dreams shifted to make room for our goals and our dreams for our life together. It only seemed reasonable that constant travel would not suffice when we had a family, so my dreams adjusted to fit into our new life.</p>
<p>Jayson always hated when I said that. But, I have never seen it as giving up what I wanted. I believe God changed my heart and allowed me to see a glimpse of what He had in store for my future.</p>
<p>So, for nearly 13 years, every decision I made was with J in mind. What I bought at the grocery. What kind of perfume I wore. What movie we watched. All these things I did with him in mind. He wasn't controlling. He really could care less, actually. I just wanted to make sure he was happy and he did the same for me.</p>
<p>We still had our own interests independent from one another. He played paintball, golfed and camped with his buddies. I liked to read, shop and hang out with my girlfriends. We both had our own identity, but we were one.</p>
<p>Then he died.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When so much of who you are is wrapped up in another for so long, you become lost without them.</p>
<p>I prided myself on being Kelly, <em>Jayson's wife.</em> I fed off his energy and passion. Now I'm Kelly, <em>young widow and single mom</em>. I really don't know this woman at all. She looks like me, but she's different. She has to be. She doesn't have her Jayson anymore.</p>
<p>I'm an introvert by nature, but Jayson helped pull out my fun loving side. I am beginning to find that on my own. I'm starting to discover my new identity.</p>
<p>After J went to be with the Lord, I needed some change so, I got my hair done (something I rarely do BC I'm so frugal). I got a tattoo. I bought new clothes and started planning out ways to redecorate my house. I didn't want to replace Jayson, but so much of what I had always done had been because I was practical. This new Kelly takes risks (after carefully considering what the outcome could be.) She's adventurous and she speaks her mind.</p>
<p>I don't have J to stand behind now, so I have to stand up for myself and my children. I have a sarcastic whit that I've only ever allowed Jayson to see. Some of my friends have really enjoyed this side of me that I've always been a little fearful of. I've learned to say no to the things I don't want to do and to ask for help when I need it. I've learned it's OK to not have all the answers all the time.</p>
<p>I don't immediately recognize myself these days when I look in the mirror, but I like what I see. Through adversity, God has revealed to me a strong woman who can sail past whatever life throws her way. She's not fearless, but knows God is in control and that eases those fears. She attempts to fight her battles with grace and wants to show her children that even though this was never a part of the plan, God will make it for His good.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"She is clothed in strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue."</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em> Proverbs 31:25-26</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thanks y'all!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kelly</p>

		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p style="text-align: center;">Last night, my friend was trying to talk my almost 3 year old into sleeping in her own bed. They went back and forth for a while before I interveined. <em>"You can't reason with crazy"</em> I informed my friend. (My sister coined this phrase earlier in the week and I LOVE it!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yes, LuLu is a child. I get that she doesn't understand. However, this phrase applies perfectly to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She's crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What sane person jumps on a wet bed after they've been told it's not water, but pee? They don't!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who hugs a dog so tight that the dog has to snarl and nip at them to be let go? That would be a CRAZY person.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">That's my LuLu.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> She just does whatever is on her little mind whenever it appears. No form of punishment detours her. Once she's committed, it will be done. Watch out if she's running towards you, chances are your about to be her next victim. She's only 25lbs but the kid is all strength and doesn't realize it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> However, she's also very loving and compassionate. She's the first one to run up to a crying child, put her hands on her knees and ask "what's wrong buddy?" Sometimes she's what caused the child to cry, but she still didn't like to see anyone sad. She's constantly asking LK and I if we're happy and she gives hugs "so you won't be crazy no more."  (I may or may not use the phrase "you're making me crazy" a little too much...)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I love her.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's probably the only person in this world who drives me nuts and makes me laugh uncontrollably at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's so much like her daddy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She terrifies me with her fearlessness. She believes she's invensable. She carries her emotions on her sleeve and you can tell what she's thinking just by the look on her face. She's fantastically animated. She's easily excited and will go on for days about the smallest things. Her smile can make even the worst of days better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most days, she makes me question my sanity, but I'm so blessed to be her momma. She keeps Leah and I on our toes and makes life so much more interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After Jayson died, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to handle her and her spirited attitude. I understand now that her sweet and sassy spirit is a huge part of what gets me through the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She's my LuLu and I think I'll keep her, crazy and all.</p>

			<p><p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes, it's hard to know what to pray for.</p>
<p> I have a dear friend who I've watched battle a very aggressive form of brain cancer for the past 2 years. It hasn't been easy. But, I just knew it would all turn out fine.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't it?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She's young. She's so full of life. She's a great person.</p>
<p> I just got a message saying she's back in the hospital. She had to be put in a medically induced coma to help her body. Jayson had to have that done as well, but he never woke up.</p>
<p>A lady I met at the hospital asked me what I wanted her to pray for. She was conflicted. She has a hard time praying for J to be healed when she knew he was so close to seeing the face of Jesus. I didn't understand why praying for healing was so difficult.</p>
<p>Now I do.</p>
<p>I'm praying for comfort for my friend's family, but how do I pray for her? See, I've lived this already. I remember just <em>knowing</em> in my heart that God would heal my husband. There was no doubt in my mind he would come home with the girls and I. But I walked out of the hospital without J and as much as I want my friend to be healed, I've learned that's not always in God's plan.</p>
<p>I despise this new found knowledge. I want to go back to my bubble where the world is sunshine and roses, where the good guy always wins and where everything turns out great in the end.</p>
<p>Sounds like a cheesy movie, huh?</p>
<p>That's where I lived my life up until September 1, 2014. Then, I learned what it really means to live on a fallen world. A world we weren't meant to be in, where we are separate from God, where there is death and disease and hunger and sin.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be awesome if we could go back and throw a piece of that fruit at Eve? Or better yet, knock said fruit out of her hand and stop her from consuming it. Stupid girl didn't know how good she had it. She had to go ruin it for the rest of us.... I digress.</p>
<p>So, for now, I'll keep praying for comfort for her family and God's will for her. She's a sunshine and roses kind of gal too. She's hanging on for now and fighting the good fight with a smile and joy in her heart.</p>
<p>The world needs more of that.</p>

			<p><p style="text-align: center;">How can one feel alone when surrounded by people?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's a strange concept for most, but when you've lost the person closest to you it's something you experience everyday. No one can understand unless they've been there and those are the last people you want to turn to because no one wants a reminder of that feeling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, how is one supposed to go at this alone?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who do you cry to when the one who comforted you can't?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who do you share your joys, sadness, frustrations with now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who can you tell anything to without fear of judgement?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who's going to help you make those hard decisions like what color to paint a room or what kind of sandwich meat to buy?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don't know the answer to these questions. But if you have these same questions, know you are not alone. Out there is someone feeling the same thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Me, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> I definitely do not have it all together and some days I just wish I could pick up the phone to call Jayson "just because." But I can't.  I do however, surround myself with friends and family that make me feel safe. I've learned that transparency is not all bad. I've learned it's ok to have bad moments or days. It's ok for my girls to see me cry. It's even better for them to watch me pick myself up and go on with life. They are learning that there are things in this world that we can't control, but we don't have to allow them to control us. I am learning this as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So, for those reading this that feel alone and think that no one knows how it feels:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You are never alone. God is holding you and will guide you every step of the way. When you feel lost, take it one breath at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out. God's already done that. He knows your pain and He'll carry you through it if you allow him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> You may be angry with God and that's ok too. Yell, tell him how you feel. Throw things. Scream into pillows til your throat hurts (it won't take long and yes I know this from experience). Then, pick yourself up, THANK HIM for the time you were allowed to spend with HIS child before they were called home and then move forward. That looks different for us all. Don't expect it to be easy and don't go at it alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sign up for a Grief Group, journal, talk to your Pastor or a licensed counselor (Check my resources tab). Allow yourself to grieve, but don't allow yourself to go at it alone. It doesn't work and we were never meant to be alone anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>It is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.</strong> —<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31:8&amp;version=ESV">Deuteronomy 31:8</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What could anyone add to this promise? God is with us; He sees despair, and He promises to be with us throughout our seasons of grief.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope this little rant helps someone in some way and always feel free to share or comment if you have questions!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kelly</p>

			<p><p style="text-align: center;">Ever feel like your living someone else's life?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ever look around and wonder "Is this real?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That's everyday for me. Nothing is as it was. It's as if I'm living in a really screwy alternate universe where your worse fears come to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Losing J was my worse fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A dear friend of mine lost her husband 9 years ago. She and I have been friends since we were 13 and "odd." I immediately rushed to her parents house. I didn't know  if she wanted me there, but I showed up anyway. I didn't know what to say. I don't even remember what we talked about. I just remember laying in her parents bed with she and her sister. Thinking of that day makes me tear up. She was 22 and had a 3 month old.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She was the first person I called when J died. It was midnight and I just needed to talk to someone who knew my pain. All I could say was "How do I tell my girls?"  She didn't have an answer but gave me the best advice anyone has given me :</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"You are not crazy. No matter what you do or say or think, remember <strong>YOU ARE NOT CRAZY</strong>."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Seems silly that those words were the first thing she said to me, but I very quickly began to  understand what she meant.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I couldn't make decisions. I forgot to eat. I even forgot to go to the bathroom.  I had people "assigned" to me everyday. They had lists of things I was to accomplish that day. I had a schedule set by my friends, planning my every move. For the first week, I didn't stay at my own home. Leah and I were shuttled from home to home and looked after by extended family. A schedule was even made for my LuLu and who was in charge of her for the day. I wasn't in control of my own life and that was fine by me. I didn't feel competent to care for myself let alone my children.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> When I did go home almost a week and a half after J died, I had people stay with us overnight. It was an adjustment learning how to live without him. Feeding my children, getting them dressed and bathed, keeping their spirits up when mine were down were terribly difficult tasks. Slowly, I weaned myself off the help within about 2 months. The first night I was left alone with my girls, I had to call a friend to ask her what I was going to feed them for dinner. She walked me through what I had in my freezer and we settled on left over chicken and dumplins.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was simply lost without J.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Things are getting better though.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I still have trouble making simple decisions, but I can make them. I have days I forget to eat, but not as often. I sometimes hide in my room with the door locked and let my girls fight it out until they realize no one's gonna stop them. We eat out ALOT, but tonight I cooked breakfast for dinner and burned the bacon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I'm not perfect, but I'm trying.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I get up every morning and look my worst fear in the face. This is the new reality that I have to live. I'm attempting to make the best of a crappy situation and move forward. However, I'm not sure this feeling of a false reality will ever go away. I hope it does.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I do know a couple of truths though:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I have seen my worst fear and lived to share my experience,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am stronger than I ever thought possible and....</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>God is good <em>regardless</em> <em>and always.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We will move forward, overcome and be better because of this struggle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kelly</p>

			<p><p>I dreamt about him last night.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen very often, but when it does I'm sad when i wake up. In my dreams I'm aware he's gone. But, he finds a way back, like it was all just a bad dream.</p>
<p>In my dreams, i can't let him go. We dance, we laugh, we talk about the girls, it's wonderful. Last night, we danced to End of the Road by Boyz to Men (90's kid). He spun me in circles, held me close, playfully dipped me backwards and pretended to drop me... all the things we always did.<br />
I miss dancing in the kitchen. I miss him grabbing me inappropriately in public and saying "what?" like he had no idea. I miss tripping over his boots he'd just leave in the middle of the floor. I miss his laugh. I miss the idea of him cleaning his shotgun the first time a boy shows up to take out our girls. I miss that our girls can't dance with their daddy anymore. I'm heartbroken that Lauren won't know what is like to attend the Princess Ball with her Daddy.</p>
<p>I miss the idea of what our life could've been.</p>
<p>But, that's the awesome thing about dreams. For a brief second in time, he's here. In my dreams, we are together again. In my dreams, I'm whole.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-193" src="/max-repo/assets/35759-I-Know-The-Plans-I-Have-For-You-300x251.jpg" alt="http://www.lovethispic.com/image/35759/i-know-the-plans-i-have-for-you" width="350" height="293" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"Leah Katherine"</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"That is not the correct password. Try again."</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"Leeeahhh Kath-er-ine</em>"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Password doesn't match"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"LEEAAHH KATHEERINE"</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Ummm, that's not the correct password"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That's what I listened to for almost 20 minutes. LK got a password journal for Christmas and she's having a hard time getting it unlocked. See, to get into it, you must say the password EXACTLY the same way as when you set it. That's not easy for most adults, let alone a 6 year old. It can seem to be a near impossible task.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> That's how Christmas made me feel this year. It just didn't seem like an easy task to do everything as we've always done it. How can you continue doing something exactly the same as always when a huge part of you is gone?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You don't</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You change it up. Mix old traditions in with new. For us, that meant starting from scratch with decorations. I envisioned sitting in my living room floor, crying over boxes of ornaments from years past and never actually getting them put on the tree. Those boxes of decorations, once put out, would have become a shrine to Christmas past and the sentiment contained in them probably would have brought more sadness than joy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> That's not how I wanted my girls to remember their first Christmas without daddy. So, LK and I decided we needed a "Frozen" tree and went shopping. We purchased the brightest, whitest tree we saw and adorned it with everything we could find that sparkles. The smiles that followed were enough to convince me that the money spent was well worth it. (My friend, Stephanie, over at  <a href="http://theyammeringcabin.com/2014/12/14/12-days-of-everyday-beautiful-christmas-day-7-richardson-ranch/" target="_blank">The Yammering Cabin</a> graciously featured us in her Everyday Beautiful Christmas series.)</p>

<br>Mommy helping Leah put the topper on the tree this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> We still went and looked at Christmas lights, still baked cookies for Santa and still opened presents on Christmas morning. Yeah, it sucked that Jayson wasn't there with us, but we can't put our life on hold. Our girl's deserve the childhood J and I wanted for them. No one asked for any of this and yes, it is a HUGE loss for my girls and I, but they need as normal of a life as I can give them now.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We did add one new tradition in though, a balloon send off.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The girls (LK) attached had written notes and a card to a dozen balloons and we sent them to heaven as a Christmas present for Daddy and a birthday present for Jesus. We watched them fly away and later in the day, when the sun came out, LK exclaimed that they must have reached heaven because that sun was shinning now.  I hope to continue this new tradition.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-191" src="/max-repo/assets/20141225_083817-e1420143487901-169x300.jpg" alt="20141225_083817" width="169" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Christmas was good for us. There were no tears, no stress, minimal asking for daddy. My girls and I not only survived the holiday season, but we enjoyed it!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Life without my J isn't always easy. I miss him like crazy everyday. Today marks 4 months since he died and I'm not sad. Instead, I am happy that the girls are adjusting so well. I am impressed that we are all actually functioning and moving forward with life. I'm proud to say we have been making new memories without forgetting about the old.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Our life with J seems distant, yet still within reach. It's hard to actually believe he's not coming home, but it's so reassuring to know he left us surrounded by people who love us and encourage us. It's amazing the strength God has instilled in me to move forward and still  <em>REALLY LIVE</em> my life. My faith that <em>God's got this</em> is unfailing and doesn't waiver.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Maybe that's why Christmas wasn't hard. Maybe that's why I was able to kiss my babies at midnight on New Years without tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe, just maybe, God has more in store for my little family then we could ever imagine and this is only the beginning. I can't keep doing the same old thing. I can't make two holidays the same. It just isn't possible anymore. But, I can choose to accept that I can't replicate the past and choose to enjoy the here and now. I can choose to accept this gift of life God has given us and choose to treasure my memories.</p>

			<p><p style="text-align: center;">It's 2015! How'd you ring in the new year?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As for me and my girls, we spent it with great friends, lots of food, some play-dough and, of course, arm wrestling!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Are you jealous yet?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well, it gets even better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My girlfriends and I had an "Ugly face war" with friends in Ohio through Facebook. We were all winners (if you wanna call us that) and had a wonderful night!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope your 2015 brings much joy and laughter!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I will leave you with some pics from the evening (apologizing in advance if our craziness scares you) and will post again soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Happy New Year!</p>

			<p><p>My love affair with Brad Paisley began in my Senior year of high school. I was a hopeless romantic and would daydream about him singing to me and only me. There was just something about his voice. I've never swooned over a celebrity, but he's one that may just leave me speechless if we ever met.</p>
<dl id="foter-photo-figure" class="wp-caption foter-photo aligncenter" style="padding: 4px; border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #dddddd; width: 537px; color: #888888; overflow: hidden; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; position: relative; -ms-zoom: 1;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd" style="padding: 0; margin: 0;"></dd>
</dl>
<p>Jayson knew this when we met. He knew early in our relationship that I would leave him for Brad Paisley if ever the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>In college, Jayson worked for a security firm in Nashville. He was somewhat of a veteran there, so he was put in the best spots. Every year he worked backstage at the CMA's and he was never afraid to speak to any of the artists. Many of them remembered him from year to year and J was always impressed by that.</p>
<p>One particular year, very early in our relationship, he was backstage when he ran into..... Brad Paisley. A lesser man would've done something like pour dish detergent in his drink so bubbles would come out when he sang (Little Rascals reference). Not my J. With no jealousy or worry at all, he walked right up to Brad Paisley and said, <em>"Mr Paisley, my girlfriend just loves you. She swears she's gonna marry you one day."</em></p>
<p>Brad Paisley then said the words that forever changed my life:</p>
<p><em>"No. Tell her she's supposed to marry you."</em></p>
<p>So there it is folks. I owe Brad Paisley a big thank you for contributing to the best ten years of my life.</p>
<p>Jayson probably still would have asked me to marry him and I still probably would have said yes, however, it's always been a wonderful story to tell. I married my husband because Brad Paisley said so and it was the most wonderful advice ever given so, thank you Brad Paisley!</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff99cc;"><em>*On a side note, I'm not a crazy stalker Mr Paisley. So, if you ever read this and wanna hook me up with tickets to a concert and maybe some meet and greet passes, I promise to be completely normal and chill. Also, our kids are about the same age and mine are available for play dates anytime!</em></span></h4>

<p><em>I originally published this a few days back, but something went crazy and deleted a couple of my posts. I was able to dig this one up :) Thank goodness! So, here it is again. Happy Reading!</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I lay here attempting to sleep, these are the things running through my head:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>LuLu poured water in MY bed right where I lay! Great... </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Why won't my children sleep in their own beds? "Your feet do not belong on your sister's head!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Who ate a pop tart in my bed?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Stop picking your nose and wiping it on your sister!"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> I haven't washed my hair in a week! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Mom! Lauren just put a booger on me!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It is 10:00pm! Why are my children still awake?!?! </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Lauren just bit me!" </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It's 32° outside. Why won't my dog come in? (Probably because she knows she'll sleep better outside where no one's flicking boogers on anyone. Seriously, am I raising monkeys?) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Why is she talking to herself? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I roll over to find my youngest "counting" her toes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> "I got this one and this one and that one and this one."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then it hits me as I stared into her sweet little eyes. They are all I have left of their daddy. These girls are him. I no longer get to fall asleep next to my best friend, but at least I have our babies. I may get flustered and sometimes hug them a little to tight to keep from pulling my own hair out, but I wouldn't have them any other way. I may think I want my bed back, but the truth is, it's comforting for all of us.  Who cares if they sleep with me until they leave for college? Right?... I believe we all need this bit of extra security right now and one day I'll wish for this back. So, for now I'll take the biting and boogers along with the giggles and snuggles. And, if I'm lucky, one day maybe I'll get some sleep again. Good night all!</p>

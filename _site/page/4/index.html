		<section class="post-excerpt">
			<p><p style="text-align:center;">Numb.:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Christmas is gonna be hard this year."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"I just need to make it through the holidays."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Numb.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Momma, I miss my Daddy."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Where's my Daddy?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"I just want my Daddy."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>NUMB, NUMB, NUMB, NUMB, NUMB!!!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Except today. Today has been tears and more tears. Today, there's no numbness, there's just lots of stress and sadness.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I have 2 sick children. They've both been puny for the past week. In the early hours of the morning they both woke up in tears. One had severe ear pain and the other just screamed for hours and couldn't tell me why. My first thought was to meltdown with them, but at 2am that accomplishes nada. So, after a brief battle with  <em>"I can't do this"</em> and<em> "I wish J were here"</em> I went numb. It's something I just channel somehow. It seems to be my coping mechanism.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Needless to say, none of us slept well at all. However, we all need consistency, so off to school, work and the sitter we went.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> An hour into my work day, I got <em>"the call."</em>  What makes this situation worse is that we STILL don't have insurance. I've been hounding the insurance call center since September with no luck. I can take my kids to the Dr, but out if pocket expenses can really add up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> I hit my breaking point.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I was done.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I said some less than pleasant things to the insurance call center rep on the other end of the line while he tried his darndest to talk over me. They tell you nothing and talk in circles. It's so frustrating! I wish I could numb myself to them... I think I will write my congressman.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Any who....</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Although it helps me function, this numbness isn't always good. People have been so kind and generous to my children and I.  I'm always sincere in my gratitude, but I'm numb.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Thank you for the card. It was beautiful" (polite smile).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"Thank you for including us in your outing" (another polite smile).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"That gift was very thoughtful" (yet another polite smile)....</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Maybe you get the picture. I can't respond to things with the emotion I once had. I think it makes others believe I am ungrateful. As if I didn't care about their generosity .</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> This numbness keeps my guard up. I'm not the person I was 3 months ago. I can't remember to call. I don't always return texts. I don't have time for nonsense and hurt feelings. I really don't do small talk anymore and I'm more apt to keep to myself. It's not that I'm trying to be insensitive, I just really don't think anything of it. I have children that need me and they come first. Everyone and everything else is put on the back burner.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I'm numb.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I'm not numb because of the holidays. I'm numb because I lost part of me. I'm this way everyday. I know I'll <em>"get through"</em> Christmas because I've gotten through everyday for the past 3 months he's been gone. Christmas is just another day, just like Thanksgiving was. Sure, I love the meaning. Yes, I celebrate our Savior's  birth and I am passing the true meaning on to my girls, but I have yet to understand why such an emphasis is put on the holidays and getting through them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> I miss him <em>EVERYDAY.</em> I have to explain to a 2-year-old <em>EVERYDAY</em> that her Daddy's in Heaven. I have to muster up the strength to console my hurting 6-year-old <em>EVERYDAY</em>.  We make new memories without him <em>EVERYDAY</em>. I am trying to figure out who I am without Jayson<em> EVERYDAY</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">What's one day worth of memories when I have the loss staring me in the face <strong>EVERYDAY</strong>?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">AND.... I guess that's why I'm numb. Who could deal with all this from day-to-day while feeling EVERYTHING? It would drive you crazy. You'd need superpowers!  I cried when I heard an endearing story about someone helping a homeless man get back on his feet, but I didn't when someone unexpectedly left gifts on my porch for my children. That bothered me.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maybe I'm just numb to my own circumstance, or maybe God has just equipped me with what I need, when I need it so I can cope with mine and my children's new season of life with some sort of grace. I don't know. But, whatever it is, I know HE has given it to me and I will graciously accept it and glorify HIM through this storm and hopefully my family can be some kind of encouragement to others going through similar circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Thanks Y'all!</p>

<p>I was getting take out at a Mexican place down the road when I noticed a cute little plush puppy with maracas and a sombrero. The five-year old in me came out and all I wanted to do was press the button that made him sing, or whatever it was that he did.</p>
<p>He was begging to be heard, but there were a ton of people standing around. If I pressed that button it's certain everyone would stare at this lone woman in the pink hoodie standing by the musical children's toy.</p>
<p>They'd probably all think I was nuts.</p>
<p>What would possess a grown woman to do such a thing?</p>
<p>All the while, little Cami (that's what I named it) was staring me in the face. Push my button! I wanna sing! I need to dance!</p>
<p>So, I did.</p>
<p>I set him free. Then, I grabbed my food and ran out the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got me to thinking about how easily we dismiss one another because of how it may inconvenience us or how others will view us.</p>
<p>Who cares what anyone else thinks? We run around, day-to-day collecting dots and stars (You should read You Are Special by Max Lucado if you're confused). We base our worth on the opinions of others when really, if we just devote ourselves to our maker, their stickers won't stick. The world can try all day long to convince you who you should be, but who's opinion means more?</p>
<p>I smile at people. I'm pleasant, most of the time. I don't do these things for gratitude or to impress, I do them because I know first hand that <strong><em>you never know what someone else is going through. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You may never know what a huge impact your smile and kind words can make. </em></strong></p>
<p>That woman who just yelled at you in your office may have just received some bad news and she doesn't know how else to react. She may just need someone to love her through her anger and she may just come back a few days later and thank you for your kindness, even though she didn't deserve it.</p>
<p>Everyone deserves to be noticed.</p>
<p>When my daughters say my name over and over and over again, they just want to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Humor that crazy woman in the grocery store who strikes up a conversation while looking at toothbrushes. It may just be the only adult interaction she's had all day (true story).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cami the maracan shaking dog was glad to be noticed, to be acknowledged and to be set free to share his joy. I'm glad I pushed the button. Everyone stopped and stared, but for a brief second before I darted, his cute little dance made me smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*<em>Thanks for humoring my silly little rant. Obviously, I don't get out much these days and it doesn't take much to get my brain going.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Hope you have a wonderful day.</span></strong></p>

<p><img class="wp-image-100 size-full" src="/max-repo/assets/jayson-heartbeat-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" />
<br>Jayson's heartbeat</p>
<p>One night while I was at work, J called to tell me that he and a co-worker were going to get tattoos. I pleaded with him not to. I was convinced that a visible tattoo would ruin our lives. <em>Who would hire him? He'd never get a respectable job. We'd live in that tiny, 400 square foot apartment for life. How would we raise children there?</em> I'm pretty sure I hyperventilated and paramedics had to be called. Well, not really, but you would have thought he was robbing a bank, not getting a tattoo.</p>
<p>I spent more time on the phone that night than actually working. When he finally told me he couldn't go through with it I was relieved.</p>
<p><strong>White House here we come! Woo Hoo!</strong></p>
<p>He told me how he'd sat in the chair, they poked him once and he was done. He proclaimed it just hurt too bad and his co-worker mocked him for it. Then he stopped by my office. All the fears and worries of never being about to go out in public with him came running back when I saw the bandage around his left wrist.  With the simple word "<strong>FORGIVEN</strong>" he had single-handedly set us on the road to ruin.</p>
<p>I cried. Not just a little, but in that overly dramatic way that a woman who has just realized that all her hopes and dreams were just crushed cries. J felt horrible. Undoubtedly, I was supposed to laugh and call him a wimp for not going through with it. I guess he didn't know me that well back then. So, he did the best thing he could think of, he bought me a pretty bag. That was his "<em>I'm sorry I screwed up our life</em>" gift.  It was pretty and pink, so I told him we'd invest in a nice watch to cover it up.</p>
<p>Fast forward about 10 years. Jayson had been wanting to get to words "FOREVER" tattooed on his right wrist to compliment his forgiven tattoo. I would never agree to it. One was enough for me. But after his second brain tumor diagnoses, I came around. I shared with him how I would go with him and get, in his handwriting, "LOVE YOU MORE" on my left wrist. He ran through our friends home telling everyone. He was super excited. The more we discussed it, though, the more I realized how horrible his handwriting actually was. "LOVE YOU BORE" was one of the ways a friend interpreted how it would appear. Nevertheless, I made a promise and I was keeping it.</p>
<p>The day he died, I knew it was coming. That was the day I would have to give the ok to put him on life support and that's something he did not want. With all his crazy and spur of the moment things he did in his life, he was very clear on his final wishes. That Monday morning, I asked the doctors to delay taking him off the ventilator. I left the hospital to get a shower and change clothes. I didn't wanna smell funny my last few hours with him. I went to Target with my entourage and purchased sharpies. He had always wanted his friend to design a tattoo for him and I figured he could just free hand one on the fly.</p>
<p>I had been back at the hospital only a few minutes when the nurses asked me to come up. They told me, in private, that he was going on his own, cried with me and told me how sorry they were that I was losing my best friend. (His nurses became friends to me in just a few days.) I put on my best face, walked into his room and asked his parents to tell him good night. I was tired and wanted to rest. I asked one of our pastors who was there to pray him home, then everyone was gone. It was just me and my J. I called our girls and had them tell him good night. They knew he was in a coma, but didn't know what that meant. I showed him pictures and videos of our girls and although I was told he couldn't see or hear, he cried when our girls were singing Jesus Loves Me. I read him Bible verses a friend had printed out and put in a jar by his bed. I sang to him. I can't remember all the songs, but I know one was Even if the Healing Doesn't Come and another was Give Me Jesus.</p>
<p>Then I remembered his tattoo. I called my friend and asked her to bring me my bag. My friend Amy handed me a sharpie and my other friend Amanda helped me hold Jayson's ginormous hand while I wrote the word <strong>"FOREVER" </strong>on<strong> </strong>his right wrist. I then drew a little heart on his hand just because I knew it would annoy him. They helped me back into bed , put his arm around me and left. He took his last breath just moments later.</p>
<p>Our last hours together played out like a Lifetime movie. I had asked him to wait on me and he did. I asked him to allow me to be in his arms when he took his last breath, and he complied. He was awesome.</p>
<p>One month to the day, I fulfilled my end of the deal and got a tattoo. I have his final living heartbeat forever on my wrist. Everyday it still beats. Everyday it shows me he lived. His heart will forever be one with mine.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me share my heart.</p>

<p>Some of you may find this surprising, but I used to be a bit high-strung and somewhat snotty. So much, in fact, that 2 of my dearest friends, let's call them Brenda and Vanessa, did not like me. "Brenda" has been quoted saying that if you would have told her 10 years ago that she and I would be the best of friends, that she wouldn't have believed it. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have either. We were all in a small group together that my husband drug me to every week. Everyone loved him. They tolerated me. I was stuffy and tried to be prim and proper. They all liked to have fun and were way more outgoing than I was. That small group didn't last long after they cancelled one night and forgot to tell me. I stood on the front porch and watched our small group leader leave his house. He drove right past me and MY CAR sitting in front of his house and never stopped. Man, I really felt the love.</p>
<p>Somehow, J and I again ended up in a couples small group with the same 2 women and their husbands. (Different leader this time, THANK GOODNESS). They would plan outings and I would attempt to invite myself along. Somehow, eventually we all became friends and more people joined our group. We all sat together at church, had lunch at the same Chinese restaurant every Sunday, then were still excited to see one another and catch up Monday evening at group. It was as if we had a second family.Over the years, most of us have started families, some have moved churches and a couple of friends have moved away. But, one thing has always stayed constant, our unwavering love for one another.</p>
<p>When J was diagnosed with his 2nd tumor in June, we were devastated. These were the friends we turned to. They threw a party the weekend before his surgery just so we could be together for fellowship and prayer. He took part in the Ice Bucket challenge that night and danced a little penguin jig while we all laughed. When he was in surgery, they were there. Not everyone could be there physically, but the calls and texts proved that they wanted to be. When he took a turn for the worst, friends drove through the night to be by his side. When he died, they were there to hold my hand, offer encouragement and hold me at 2am when I completely lost it. You know you have a true friend when she instructs you how to breathe when you feel like you've forgotten.</p>

<br>My girls on the worst day of my life. This was taken that afternoon before J passed away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so thankful that God made these people apart of my life. They have been there through the best and worst of days. Most people can't say they have 1 best friend. I have a community of believers by my side, encouraging me, helping me raise my children and loving us through the worst season we have yet to face. It is the best gift my husband could have ever given me and I'm glad I  broke out of my shell and accepted it.</p>

<br>This was taken the day after J’s Memorial Service. These are my people (minus a few).</p>

<p>To say I am displeased with this day is an understatement. Monday is that day I have to wake up before my children if I want a shower. Monday starts the week in which I will have to drag my oldest out of bed, physically dress her myself after threatening to send her to school in her jammies, frantically get out the door to get her to school on time (without breakfast) and maybe her teeth and hair were brushed. I don't know, but I know this truancy thing is serious business and some days I think my daughter wants me to spend some time in the slammer just so she can sleep in. That's Monday folks.</p>
<p>Every Monday morning I start my healthy eating campaign. <em>"No Chick Fil-a this week"</em>  I'll tell myself. <em>HA!</em> After dragging a child out of bed and making sure she at least looks like someone loves her, who has time for breakfast at home? My waist line hates me. But, the girl at the drive thru LOVES my glasses and knows my order. She could be my newest best friend.</p>
<p>Monday is also that day that people are gonna say things to me that make me want to poke them in the eye. For example, one Monday a few weeks ago, my girls were being particularly spirited while trying to get in the car after school. I had a moment and raised my voice (Southern woman don't yell. We raise our voice) as another mother was passing by with her perfect angels. <em>"I have a copy of (insert parenting unruly children book title here). Looks like you can use it!"</em> <strong>GRRRR</strong>. In my head I instructed that mother, very kindly, where she could put that book and that what I really needed was for my husband not to be dead. However, in real life, I just kept my back turned and continued buckling my children into their seats. Thank you kind woman for being so encouraging.</p>
<p>Mostly, I loathe Monday because it took my husband.</p>
<p>However, there are some truths about Monday that I have to share. Every Monday I am privileged to wake up with 2 precious loves snuggled up against me. Monday is the beginning of my work week and I adore my job and the women I get to do life with there. Monday was my last glorious day spent with my J. Monday was the day of our last kiss. It was the day of our last good morning and our final goodbye. Monday is a good day. Monday did not take my husband. Cancer and a worn out body did. Monday was the day I realized just how much <strong>God loves me</strong>. He showed me just how <strong>strong I really am</strong>. Monday is the day God revealed just how much <strong>the people in my life really care</strong>. Monday was the day I knew everything would be ok. Monday was the day I changed the way I see God. It changed our relationship. I'm not sure just how yet, but I'm sure it will be revealed in time.</p>
<p>Oh, and someone paid for my meal at Chick Fil-a this morning. Monday, you are redeemed.</p>
<p>Happy Monday!</p>

<br>Laughter has always been a staple in our home.</p>

<br>Some crazy college kids...</p>

<br>The same crazy kids, but grown up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a <em>touch</em> of OCD when my husband and I first started dating in college. We rented our first apartment and eventually, we got married. He was bound and determined to break me of my compulsion for perfection in those early years. He would come in and shed his shoes, socks and shirt as he walked, leaving a trail of clothing through our tiny apartment. He would deposit the contents of his pockets onto our entertainment center, then sit and relax. <em>HE WOULD SIT AND RELAX. RELAX! </em>I, on the other hand, would see the clutteration (not a word. I know and I don't care.) of our 400 square foot apartment and lay in the floor and cry (I was also a bit dramatic). He would tell me to get over it and he would go along with his relaxing. This went on forever. He said that one day, when we had children, he would teach them to tilt all the pictures in our home just enough to drive me insane.</p>
<p>He never got the chance. Our girls are 6 and 2 and he left this Earth 3 months ago to spend eternity with the Lord. His infatuation with trying to cure my perfection complex never stopped and now carries on with our children.</p>

<br>Right out of surgery</p>
<p>Jayson had an infectious laugh. People around him couldn't help but be caught up in his joy. He loved life, God, his friends and especially his family. His girls were his world. He was a father, a husband, a friend, a son, a brother, an uncle, a youth leader, a mentor, a jokester, a technical support guru, a lover of history and guns and always willing to help someone in need. He once gave a teen at church the shirt he was wearing because the kid said he liked it. There was another kid who changed the spelling of his name to match Jayson's because J told the kid it was the "right" way. He influenced those around him. He was amazing.</p>
</div>
<p>He died on a Monday in September from surgical complications. He had been diagnosed with a brain tumor in June. It was the 2nd in 4 years. The first surgery was successful. There was really no reason to believe this one would be any different. He came out of surgery in great spirits. He was smiling and goofy. He was amazed that his nurse had hazel eyes, just like him. The recovery seemed to be miraculous compared to the first time. Our oldest, LK, was even able to visit him in the hospital. But that was the night everything went downhill. He slowly stopped talking and was staring off into space. He became violently sick late that night and the next day we discovered that, not only did he have a very aggressive form of brain cancer, but he also had bleeding on the brain. He was moved back to the ICU that afternoon and had a massive seizure that he never woke up from. He died 3 days later with me in his arms.</p>
<p>It all played out like a movie. People came from all over to lay hands on him and pray. I begged and pleaded in the hospital chapel in the wee hours of the morning, just knowing that God was going to heal my husband.<em> We were good people. Bad things happened to us, but they always turned out fine in the end. I asked, so I knew I would receive. I believed, so I could move mountains. I kept the faith and stayed strong.</em> <strong>I put God in a box. I held Him accountable to my standards. I acted as if He owed me. As if He served ME!</strong> Funny, huh? <strong>I was trying to make God conform to my idea of perfection, when He is perfect. God works miracles, He heals, but not always in the way we expect</strong>. God healed my husband. He gave him a new, healthy body. Our girls did not have to watch him suffer. They did not watch their daddy deteriorate. They remember him loving and strong, funny and kind. They remember him, not his sickness. I believe that is the true blessing in all of this sadness. I believe that our new life is all part of God's perfect plan.</p>

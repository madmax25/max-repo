  Sunshine and Roses...
  
    <small>12 Jan 2015</small>
  
</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes, it's hard to know what to pray for.</p>
<p> I have a dear friend who I've watched battle a very aggressive form of brain cancer for the past 2 years. It hasn't been easy. But, I just knew it would all turn out fine.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't it?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She's young. She's so full of life. She's a great person.</p>
<p> I just got a message saying she's back in the hospital. She had to be put in a medically induced coma to help her body. Jayson had to have that done as well, but he never woke up.</p>
<p>A lady I met at the hospital asked me what I wanted her to pray for. She was conflicted. She has a hard time praying for J to be healed when she knew he was so close to seeing the face of Jesus. I didn't understand why praying for healing was so difficult.</p>
<p>Now I do.</p>
<p>I'm praying for comfort for my friend's family, but how do I pray for her? See, I've lived this already. I remember just <em>knowing</em> in my heart that God would heal my husband. There was no doubt in my mind he would come home with the girls and I. But I walked out of the hospital without J and as much as I want my friend to be healed, I've learned that's not always in God's plan.</p>
<p>I despise this new found knowledge. I want to go back to my bubble where the world is sunshine and roses, where the good guy always wins and where everything turns out great in the end.</p>
<p>Sounds like a cheesy movie, huh?</p>
<p>That's where I lived my life up until September 1, 2014. Then, I learned what it really means to live on a fallen world. A world we weren't meant to be in, where we are separate from God, where there is death and disease and hunger and sin.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be awesome if we could go back and throw a piece of that fruit at Eve? Or better yet, knock said fruit out of her hand and stop her from consuming it. Stupid girl didn't know how good she had it. She had to go ruin it for the rest of us.... I digress.</p>
<p>So, for now, I'll keep praying for comfort for her family and God's will for her. She's a sunshine and roses kind of gal too. She's hanging on for now and fighting the good fight with a smile and joy in her heart.</p>
<p>The world needs more of that.</p>
<p>Kelly</p>
